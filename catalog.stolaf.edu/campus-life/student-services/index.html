This waiver must be completed each year they are enrolled at St. Olaf. If not completed prior to the 10th day of classes, the student will automatically be enrolled in the student health insurance at St. Olaf College. Information is sent to students during the summer but can also be found at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/stuacct/healthinsurance ">http://wp.stolaf.edu/stuacct/healthinsurance</a>.</p>
 <h2 headerid="4" name="text">Health Service Information for Admitted Students</h2> <p>507-786-3063 • <a href="mailto:healthservices@stolaf.edu">healthservices@stolaf.edu</a></p> <h3>Health Forms</h3> <p>Please complete the <strong>Report of Medical History</strong> and <strong>Immunization Record</strong> online at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/health-service-information-for-admitted-students/">http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/health-service-information-for-admitted-students/​</a><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/health-service-information-for-admitted-students/"> </a><strong>no later than JULY 15</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Per Minnesota law, your immunization record needs to be reviewed prior to matriculation. Students who do not provide the required immunization information will not be allowed to register for classes.</strong> Immunizations are self reported by the student on the Health Form, but students should have copies available for Health Service to review if requested. If you are having difficulty finding documentation of your immunizations, it might help to check with your high school or your health care clinic. If immunization records are not available, please schedule an appointment with your Health Care provider ASAP. The Report of Medical History will be reviewed when care is established in Health Service during an office visit or if needed in an emergency.</p> <p>If you have questions about these forms or other health-related matters at St. Olaf College, please contact Health Service directly at 507-786-3063. During the summer months send an email to <a href="mailto:healthservices@stolaf.edu">healthservices@stolaf.edu</a>.</p> <h3>Immunizations</h3> <p><strong>St Olaf requires all students to submit dates for the following immunizations:</strong></p> <ul> 	<li>Diphtheria/Tetanus—Td (dose <strong>within</strong> the past 10 years).  Obtain booster if needed.  <strong>*Please make sure you record the most recent tetanus booster on the online health record.</strong></li> 	<li>Measles—Rubeola, Red measles (2 doses <strong>after</strong> age 12 months).</li> 	<li>Mumps—(2 doses <strong>after</strong> age 12 months).</li> 	<li>Rubella—German measles (2 doses <strong>after</strong> age 12 months).</li> 	<li>Meningitis vaccine <strong>within</strong> 5 years of matriculation.  Obtain booster if needed.  <strong>*Please make sure you record the most recent booster on the online health record.</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Students are highly encouraged to have vaccinations for hepatitis A  and hepatitis B.  </strong></p> <p>*International students who are not able to receive any vaccine before matriculation can obtain the vaccine at a local clinic once they have arrived on campus.  Clinics and transportation options are listed on the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/">Health Service website</a>. There will be a cost to the student for vaccination, but insurance may cover.  Students are responsible for contacting their insurance carrier to check on coverage of vaccinations.</p> <p>Information about Meningococcal Disease:    <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/meningococcal-disease/" target="_blank">http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/meningococcal-disease/</a></p> <p>Information about Viral Hepatitis and the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Vaccines:   <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/viral-hepatitis-and-the-hepatitis-a-and-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" target="_blank">http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/viral-hepatitis-and-the-hepatitis-a-and-hepatitis-b-vaccines/</a></p> <h3><strong>International Students</strong></h3> <p>International students arriving from countries with an increased incidence of tuberculosis (TB) or students with identifiable risk factors for exposure to TB and/or for TB disease should complete TB screening before arrival on campus. The Report of Medical History form will help determine who needs screening. Screening needs to be within 6 months prior to college entrance. If not done before arrival, it must be done within the first month of school. Screening is not usually covered by insurance and students may incur an out-of-pocket cost to complete the required screening.</p> <h3><strong>About Health Service</strong></h3> <p>Health Service provides acute and preventative services for St Olaf Students. Health Service staff is experienced in treating common medical problems. Health Service offers initial diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and appropriate referrals for a broad spectrum of minor illnesses and injuries.</p> <p>Health Service is staffed by a Certified Nurse Practitioner and support staff.</p> <p><strong>Clinic hours</strong> are by appointment Monday–Friday, 9:00-11:30 am and 1-4 pm. Students can e-mail or call Health Service for an appointment. Health Service is closed during student breaks, summer, and occasional days during the school year. If health care is needed during those times, students can access local providers. A list of those providers is on the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/" target="_blank">Health Service</a> website. Transportation information is available on the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/sa/transportation/" target="_blank">Transportation website</a>. Students will need to bring an insurance card and photo ID for off-campus clinics.</p> <p>There is no charge for office visits, but fees may apply for services such as: medication, immunizations, TB skin tests, lab tests, and supplies. <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/olecard/" target="_blank" title="Ole Card">Ole Cards</a> are requested for payment.

Lab work may also be drawn per outside provider’s order and results faxed to ordering provider.</li> 	<li>Reproductive care including contraceptive counseling, emergency contraception, STI screening.</li> 	<li><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/prescription-refill/" target="_blank">Prescription delivery</a>: Prescriptions may also be filled at local pharmacies and delivered to St. Olaf College for student pick-up.</li> 	<li>Immunizations:  Td/Tdap, Hepatitis A, and Typhoid prescriptions.  TB skin tests are also available.  Contact Health Service for availability and cost.  Cost for immunizations is out of pocket.  </li> 	<li>Travel immunizations and medications for St Olaf study abroad.</li> 	<li>A two-day flu immunization clinic held on campus during the fall semester.</li> 	<li>Equipment available for loan including crutches, canes, slings, heating pads, and educational materials.</li> 	<li>Referral of students to other medical providers as needed.</li> </ul> <p>Health Service may not have the resources to manage chronic or complicated conditions, so it is important for those students with chronic conditions to find  a provider in the local area with whom to establish care before an urgent need rises. For your convenience, the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/health/">Health Service website</a> has a list of local providers. Health Service can also help refer students to providers. Please check with insurance regarding coverage of referral services.</p> <p>Health Service does not manage the Student Health Insurance Plan.

Suggested basic items: pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, an inexpensive digital thermometer, various sized band aids, cold or allergy medication, throat lozenges, Tums, tweezers, ice pack, antibiotic ointment, non-stick gauze, adhesive tape, insect repellent with DEET, and sunscreen.</li> 	<li>Consider getting a flu shot before arrival on campus. It's one less thing you need to think about during the school year.</li> 	<li>Check with your health care provider to make sure immunizations are up to date. Get a physical if you are due for one. A physical is not required for matriculation, but is strongly recommended for all students before arrival on campus. Having a physical allows your health care provider an opportunity to update any needed immunizations, refill medications, and assess health needs. Physicals are not available on campus.</li> 	<li>See your dentist for a regular check up at least 6 months prior to coming to school.</li> 	<li>If you wear contacts, bring a back-up pair of glasses to campus.</li> 	<li>Bring a copy of your insurance card or information and keep it in a place you can find it if needed for off campus clinics and prescriptions.</li> 	<li>Transfer prescriptions to a local pharmacy if needed. See Health Service Web site for campus delivery instructions.</li> </ul>
