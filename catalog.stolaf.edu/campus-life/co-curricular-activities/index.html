<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="1" name="text">Student Organizations and Co-Curricular Involvement</h2>
 <h3><span class="subhead">Student Activities</span></h3> <p class="body">There are many opportunities outside the classroom that help students put their ideals into practice and make life-long friends. Student activities are designed to complement the academic program of studies and to enhance the overall educational experience of students through development of, exposure to, and participation in social, cultural, intellectual, recreational, and governance programs.</p> <p class="body">Student activities are planned and implemented through collaborative efforts by the <a href="http://oleville.com/" target="_blank">Student Government Association</a>, under the leadership of the director of student activities.</p> <h3>Student Government <a href="http://www.oleville.com/" target="_blank">(SGA)</a> </h3> <p class="body">Each student is a member of the St. Olaf College student community and may participate in the election of its officers.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The St. Olaf <a href="http://oleville.com/senate/" target="_blank">Student Senate</a></strong>, composed of elected student representatives, is the legislative division of the SGA. The senate is elected by the student body and serves as the main liaison with the administration and faculty. It consists of SGA division chairs and representatives from residence halls and campus-wide committees. It is the official student government on campus. It represents the interests of the St. Olaf College student community, overseeing student-related affairs. Copies of the St. Olaf Student Senate Constitution and meeting minutes are available online at <a href="http://oleville.com/">Oleville</a>.</p> <p class="body">At first glance, the name, Student Government Association (SGA), is slightly misleading. The SGA is not a separate committee itself, but the term used in referring to its ten divisions, in addition to student media. These divisions are the Board of Regents Student Committee, Diversity Celebrations Committee, Music Entertainment Committee, The Pause, Political Awareness Committee, Student Activities Committee, Student Organizations Committee, Student Senate, Volunteer Network, and After Dark Committee.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The After Dark Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/adc/" target="_blank">ADC</a>)</strong> creates fun events for students after 10 p.m. on weekends.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Board of Regents Student Committee <a href="http://oleville.com/borsc/" target="_blank">(BORSC</a>)</strong> is responsible for gathering and voicing students' concerns to the governing body of St. Olaf, the Board of Regents.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Diversity Celebrations Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/dcc/" target="_blank">DCC)</a></strong> coordinates the many cultural celebrations held on campus each year through its supported eleven student organizations. These include Black History Month, Viva La Raza, Asia Weeks, and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Music Entertainment Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/mec/" target="_blank">MEC</a>)</strong> is responsible for booking all musical acts on campus. Its goal is to bring diverse musical genres ranging from solo acoustic to touring bands. Past performances include Lizzo, Black Eyed Peas, Jesse McCartney, Ingrid Michealson, Andy Grammar, Doomtree, and OK Go.</p> <p class="body"><a href="http://oleville.com/pause/" target="_blank"><strong>The Lion's Pause</strong></a>, located in <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/buntrock/" target="_blank">Buntrock Commons</a>, is a place as well as an SGA division. It provides space for students to kick back and grab a shake or homemade pizza from The Pause kitchen.</p> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px"><strong>The Mane Stage</strong> is a fully functioning performance venue modeled after First Ave in Minneapolis. It is perfect for large performances, concerts, and dances.</p> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px"><strong>The Lair</strong> is a much smaller venue, located in between the Den and the Kitchen. It is designed to have a cozier feel, suitable for acoustic shows, open mic nights, or other smaller performances.</p> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Sit back and relax with some food, or have a study group with friends in the comfortable seating of <strong>the</strong> <strong>Jungle</strong>.</p> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px"><strong>The Den</strong> is equipped with a pool table and full entertainment system. Come watch the next big game with us!</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Political Awareness Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/pac/" target="_blank">PAC</a>)</strong> strives to keep students on top of critical political and social issues by bringing in national speakers, such as Karl Rove, Angela Davis, Gretchen Morgenstern, Newt Gingrich, Rev. Al Sharpton, and Arianna Huffington. It also works to keep students aware of election issues and candidates.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Student Activities Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/sac/" target="_blank">SAC</a>)</strong> features four sub-committees that program special events such as comedians and magicians, promote Ole pride at sporting events, show weekly movies on campus, provide opportunities for students to venture off-campus, and plan Ole traditions such as Homecoming, the President's Ball, and Senior Days.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Student Organizations Committee (<a href="http://oleville.com/soc/" target="_blank">SOC</a>)</strong> oversees 200+ student organizations, ranging from academic and honorary groups such as Neuroscience Club and Sigma Tau Delta (Student Nursing Association)  to club sports such as men’s and women’s ultimate frisbee. SOC grants formal recognition status and coordinates grants and funding to these organizations to help them with the planning of programs and activities. Student groups are free to organize and regulate their own activities within the limits set forth by college policy. The specific roles appropriate for each of the student organizations are specified by the constitutions of these bodies.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The Volunteer Network (<a href="http://oleville.com/vn/" target="_blank">VN</a>)</strong> provides St. Olaf students with a wide range of rewarding volunteer opportunities in Northfield and the surrounding communities, such as pet therapy with nursing home residents, tutoring in Northfield schools, Special Olympics, and being role models for Northfield youth. It supports the service student organizations as well.</p> <p class="body">All divisions of the SGA are entirely student-run and are funded by the students of St. Olaf.</p> <h3 class="body"><span class="subhead">Student Media</span></h3> <p class="body">All student media offices are in the Buntrock Commons.</p> <p class="body"><em><a href="http://www.manitoumessenger.com/" target="_blank">The Manitou Messenger</a>,</em> founded in 1887, is the college newspaper published weekly by students for the St. Olaf College community. It is the medium for announcing and reporting campus-related events and for expressing student and faculty opinions.</p> <p class="body"><em><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/orgs/list/index.cfm?fuseaction=orginfo&amp;OrgID=453&amp;currentaction=listallorgs" target="_blank">The Quarry</a>, a St. Olaf Literary Arts Magazine,</em> is the publication of the creative arts at St. Olaf College. It stimulates and solicits creative work from students and faculty members as well as from other sources and is published each spring.</p> <p><span class="body"><a href="http://pages.stolaf.edu/ksto/" target="_blank">KSTO</a> is the student FM radio station for the St. Olaf College community. Its broadcasts include music, athletic events, community service announcements, and taped programs from college and outside sources. KSTO, 93.1 FM, is student-run and operated 18 hours a day, seven days a week. <a href="http://pages.stolaf.edu/ksto/" target="_blank">Webcast available</a>.</span></p> <h3 class="subhead">Community Volunteer Services</h3> <p class="body">A large number of St. Olaf students participate in numerous volunteer activities in the local Northfield area and surrounding communities. Students regularly visit with area youth and adults in need.  Some students also visit shelters to help the facility staff and play with animals. Other students contribute their time and talents visiting senior citizens in the local hospital and retirement centers, as well as participating in a number of tutorial opportunities within the Northfield schools and local literacy programs. Interested students may contact the student coordinator of the St. Olaf <a href="http://oleville.com/vn/" target="_blank">Volunteer Network </a>in the<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/sa/" target="_blank"> Office of Student Activities</a> for more information.</p> <h2 class="body" headerid="2" name="text">Councils</h2> <p class="body"><strong>The Interhall Council (<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/reslife/leadership/">IHC</a>)</strong> plays a significant governing role in the shaping of residential life. Membership is determined by elections held in the fall. The hall councils meet regularly to program activities and review the needs and concerns of hall residents.</p> <p class="body"><strong>The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/honorcouncil/">Honor Council</a></strong> (in conjunction with a College Judiciary and a College Appeals Board) is the primary body for hearing discipline cases involving academic dishonesty.</p> <p class="body">For more detailed information about campus governance, consult <em>The Book</em>, available <a href=" http://wp.stolaf.edu/thebook/" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>
 <h3 class="subhead">St. Olaf as a Worshiping Community</h3> <p class="body">St. Olaf’s primary aim is to provide the best possible education. As a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, St. Olaf intentionally carries out that aim in the context of a worshiping Christian community.</p> <p class="body">In addition to the study of theology, the college provides time, facilities, and personnel to sustain the worship life of the community of faith on campus. A <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/ministry/worship/" target="_blank">20-minute chapel service</a> in Boe Memorial Chapel every weekday is part of the college’s regular schedule. The St. Olaf faculty and student body exercise the privilege of voluntary attendance at these services.</p> <p class="body">Sunday morning worship on campus is the responsibility of the student congregation. Because of the denominational affiliation of the college, the worship services generally follow the liturgical tradition. The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/ministry/staff/" target="_blank">College Ministry Staff</a>, together with the student congregation, does, however, carry on a ministry addressed to the needs and interests of all students, regardless of church affiliation. The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/ministry/area-congregations-2/" target="_blank">various churches</a> in the Northfield community cordially invite students to participate with them as well.</p> <p class="body">In addition to supervising the daily chapel services and the activities of the student congregation, the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/ministry/" target="_blank">College Ministry Office</a> is always open to students who wish to discuss personal, vocational, or religious areas of concern, or who simply desire to inquire about ways to get involved in the various religious activities available on campus. This is done with complete confidentiality.</p>
 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="3" name="text">Varsity, Club, and Intramural Sports</h2> <p class="body">St. Olaf offers an extensive program of intercollegiate, club, and intramural sports. Excellent facilities and coaching are available for the large number of students who wish to take part in sports activities.</p> <h3 class="subhead">Intercollegiate Competition</h3> <p class="body">St. Olaf athletic teams compete in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which includes 12 colleges in addition to St. Olaf: Augsburg, Bethel, Carleton, Concordia, Gustavus Adolphus, Hamline, Macalester, St. Benedict, St. Catherine, St. John’s, St. Mary’s, and St. Thomas.</p> <p class="body">The program of intercollegiate athletics for men includes baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, hockey, nordic and alpine skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, and wrestling.</p> <p class="body">The intercollegiate athletics program for women includes basketball, cross country, softball, golf, hockey, nordic and alpine skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.</p> <p class="body">The intercollegiate athletics program is considered an integral part of the college, and its purpose and scope are educational in concept and in operation. This philosophy reflects institutional ideals and objectives, and its supervision and control are vested in the faculty.</p> <p class="body">Eligibility for intercollegiate athletics is certified by the faculty in accordance with Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference policy.</p> <p class="body">Of the two courses required to complete the SPM general education requirement, one and only one may be through credit via an intercollegiate sport. See regulations concerning <a href="../../curriculum/graduate-requirements-degrees/general-education-requirements-ba/index.html">general education.</a></p> <h3 class="subhead">Intramural and Club Sport Options</h3> <p class="body">The intramural program offers a wide range of activities to meet the needs and desires of as many students as possible. The program includes dozens of activities offering competitive and non-competitive opportunities for men’s, women’s, and coed teams. There are also a number of club sports, teams which are not sponsored as intercollegiate sports, that provide “extramural” competitive experiences in sports such as Ultimate Frisbee™, men’s volleyball, lacrosse, rugby, and cycling. Intramural and club sports do not carry academic credit and do not count toward fulfillment of any graduation requirements.</p> <h3 class="subhead">Recreation</h3> <p class="body">There are many opportunities for general recreation and free play for all students. Several types of aerobic and weight machines are available for use in the Tostrud Center and in Tom Porter Hall. The gym, fieldhouse, weight room, climbing wall, and pool facilities in these buildings are available throughout the day and evening hours, and on weekends. The Ytterboe outdoor courts and the outdoor fields and hiking/skiing trails surrounding the campus are also available for student use.  Our St. Olaf Outdoor Recreation Program (STORP) provides rental equipment for a minimum fee for camping gear and winter sports such cross country skis and snowshoes.</p> <h3 class="subhead">Athletic Facilities</h3> <p class="body">Skoglund Athletic Center and Tostrud Center houses all indoor sports, including basketball, wrestling, swimming, indoor track, and tennis. The gymnasium-auditorium, with three full-sized basketball courts, has seating for 2,000 at intercollegiate basketball, volleyball, and wrestling events. The swimming pool has six seven-foot-wide racing lanes and spectator seating for 300. The fieldhouse with a textured mondo surface contains a 200-meter track, areas for indoor track and field events, and ample room for indoor baseball, football, softball, soccer, and golf practice throughout the year. Five tennis courts provide students with indoor tennis play.</p> <p class="body">The two-story common unit links all other elements of the Athletic Center and includes a spacious lobby concourse, classrooms, offices, locker rooms, double-mat wrestling room, weight-training room, training room, and one handball/racquetball court.</p> <p class="body">Outdoor facilities include a turf football stadium, adjoining practice fields, a nine-lane artificial surface outdoor track, a separate soccer game field and four adjacent practice fields, tennis courts (6), baseball field, softball field, and numerous intramural fields. Porter Hall houses a strength room, meeting/aerobics room, training room, two team dressing rooms, an equipment room, public rest rooms, and general changing areas.</p>
 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="4" name="text">Express Yourself</h2> <h3 class="subhead">Dance</h3> <p class="body"><strong>Companydance</strong> offers students a range of dance creating, performing and producing opportunities. It is open by audition to <strong><u>all</u></strong> students. The company's primary aesthetic tends toward the modern dance tradition, but is by <u>no</u> means restricted to it. Auditions for Companydance are held during the first week of the fall term.</p> <p class="body"><strong>Veselica International Dance Ensemble</strong> is open by audition to <strong>all</strong> students. The company exemplifies a global perspective that strives to spread awareness of dance forms from around the world. Veselica (pronounced veh-SELL-eetsah) translates as &quot;celebration&quot; in Serbo-Croatian. Artistic Director Anne von Bibra founded the international dance ensemble in the late 1980s. Auditions for Veselica are held during the first week of the fall term and sometimes during the spring term.</p>
 <h3 class="subhead">Music Ensembles</h3> <p class="body">St. Olaf College is renowned for its excellent music ensembles. Seven choirs, two orchestras, two symphonic bands, three jazz bands, early music vocal and instrumental ensembles, handbell choirs, and other groups continue a rich tradition begun by F. Melius Christiansen more than 100 years ago when he founded the St. Olaf Music Department. Nearly 1,000 students participate in these ensembles each year.</p> <p class="body">The annual <strong>St. Olaf Christmas Festival</strong> is a highlight of the Christmas season for many on campus and around the world. Featuring the St. Olaf Choir, the St. Olaf Chapel Choir, the St. Olaf Cantorei, the Manitou Singers, the Viking Chorus, and St. Olaf Orchestra performing as individual groups and as a mass ensemble, the festival attracts over 12,000 people to campus for four concerts and is heard by tens of thousands more on public radio and television stations across the nation.</p> <p class="body"><strong>St. Olaf Choir</strong>, with 75 mixed voices, is the pioneer <em>a cappella</em> choir in the United States. For more than a century, the St. Olaf Choir has maintained its original purpose — study and performance of a wide range of sacred choral literature. Private lessons in voice are required for all members. During annual tours in the United States and abroad, the ensemble exemplifies the highest artistic standards in choral music performance.</p> <p class="body"><strong>St. Olaf Chapel Choir</strong>, an ensemble of 120 mixed voices, performs a wide range of choral repertoire that includes larger works for choir and orchestra.
