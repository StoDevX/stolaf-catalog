 <h3>Academic Advising Office</h3> <p class="body">The Academic Advising office<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/registrar/" target="_blank"> </a> provides administrative and curricular support to all St. Olaf students and faculty advisors. The center provides high-quality, timely service on routine and general academic curricular questions and encourages all students to become more knowledgeable and involved in planning their academic programs.</p>  <p class="body">During the regular academic year, students may make appointments with staff members in Academic Advising office.  Contact information: phone (507) 786-6797, fax (507) 786-3758, email: <a href="mailto:advise@stolaf.edu">advise@stolaf.edu</a> </p>  <h3 class="programdescription">Academic Advising</h3> <p class="programdescription">Academic advising at St. Olaf College encourages the integration of the mind, body, and spirit as students learn to create academic, career, and lifelong goals. Students discover how to direct their intellectual curiosity, to overcome personal or academic barriers to learning, and to pursue their goals. Central to this educational process is the collaboration between students and their faculty advisors.</p> <h4 class="body">Academic Peer Advisors</h4> <p class="body">Academic Peer Advisors are a select group of current St. Olaf College students who assist in providing quality, timely service on routine and general academic curricular questions. They enable their peers to become more knowledgeable and involved in planning their academic programs. Academic Peer Advisors also assist with academic planning sessions during Week One (new student orientation), set up academic planning sessions during the year, provide support during registration times, and assist the Assistant Registrar for Academic Advising, Transfer Credit, and the First-Year Experience as needed.</p> <h3 class="subhead">Advisors</h3> <p class="body">The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/aac/" target="_blank">Academic Advising office</a>  assigns a faculty advisor to each student. After completing at least one semester, all students may change to a different faculty advisor at any time during the academic year, with the permission of the new advisor via an electronic change of advisor form. The Academic Advising office and the department chairs and program directors oversee the reassignment of advisees for faculty on sabbaticals or other leaves. Generally speaking, no individual faculty member has more than 20 advisees in any given year.</p>  <p class="body">The advice of faculty advisors does not constitute a promise or a contract ensuring a student’s graduation on schedule or the completion of specific requirements. Students and faculty advisors must refer to the<a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm"> </a> <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm" target="_blank">class and lab schedules</a>  to determine which courses fulfill specific graduation requirements. The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student. Students have access to their academic records at any time on St. Olaf’s <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm" target="_blank">Student Information System (S.I.S)</a> .</p>  <h3 class="subhead">Goals for Academic Advising</h3> <p class="body"><strong>Through academic advising, students at St. Olaf:</strong></p> <ol> 	<li class="body">examine the purpose of higher education at a liberal arts institution;</li> 	<li class="body">examine goals and objectives of the <a href="../../curriculum/mission/index.html">St. Olaf mission statement;</a> </li>  	<li class="body">develop an understanding of the goals and purpose of the St. Olaf <a href="../../curriculum/graduate-requirements-degrees/general-education-requirements-ba/index.html">general education curriculum</a> ;</li>  	<li class="body">learn to use<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/aac/resources/"> </a> <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/aac/resources/" target="_blank">resources on the St. Olaf campus</a> ;</li>  	<li class="body">learn to analyze and develop an academic plan each semester using the<a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm"> </a> <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm" target="_blank">Student Information System;</a> </li>  	<li class="body">learn to prioritize competing responsibilities (academic, co-curricular, and personal);</li> 	<li class="body">assess interests and talents and develop academic, personal, and career goals;</li> 	<li class="body">integrate knowledge and skills acquired before and during study at St. Olaf;</li> 	<li class="body">develop a desire for life-long learning.</li> </ol>  <h3 class="subhead">Students' Roles and Responsibilities</h3> <p class="body"><em>The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student.</em></p> <p class="body"><strong>In order to take full advantage of the wide range of academic opportunities at St. Olaf College, students are expected to:</strong></p> <ol> 	<li class="body">express their academic interests and aspirations to their faculty advisor;</li> 	<li class="body">respond promptly to messages from their faculty advisor;</li> 	<li class="body">prepare carefully for meetings with their advisor;</li> 	<li class="body">develop a 4-year academic plan that assists in pursuing a broad range of academic interests, in graduating in a timely manner, and in facilitating a desire for life-long learning;</li> 	<li class="body">learn how to read a degree audit;</li> 	<li class="body">explore the breadth of the <a href="../../curriculum/graduate-requirements-degrees/general-education-requirements-ba/index.html">general education curriculum</a> , in order to understand the significance of each of the requirements;</li>  	<li class="body">pursue an in-depth course of study within a <a href="../../curriculum/majors-concentrations-areas-emphasis-teaching-certifications/index.html">major field</a> <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/catalog/1415/academicprogram/"> </a> chosen from those offered at St. Olaf or independently developed with the assistance and approval of <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/cis/">The </a> <a href="../../academic-programs/integrative-studies/index.html">Center for Integrative Studies</a> <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/cis/">.</a>  Each student must declare one major by fall semester of a student's junior year; however, students may declare a major prior to that time.

 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="1" name="text">Academic Support Centers</h2> <p class="body">The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/asc/" target="_blank">Academic Support Center</a> s (ASC), in collaboration with faculty, staff, and students, assist students who strive to become stronger independent and collaborative learners. The ASC's staff assists those who want to improve their academic performance, either in general or in a particular course. Programs offered by the ASC include:</p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Academic Tutoring</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">One-on-one peer tutoring is available in most subjects and is provided upon request, referral and feedback from faculty, and the availability of tutors.  In addition to strengthening students' understanding of course material, tutors will assist students to identify subject areas to study or practice, discuss effective participation methods in class, and convey new study techniques.  Peer tutors are also available to assist with organization, time management, and study strategies.  Tutors collaborate with faculty and Academic Support Centers staff to monitor student progress.       </p> <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Writing Center</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">In St. Olaf's <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/asc/writing-help/" target="_blank">Writing Center</a> , writing tutors offer in-person writing help with most kinds of writing assignments.  Tutors ask questions, listen, and provide feedback.  Writing sessions typically focus on brainstorming ideas, strengthening theses, developing thesis support, organizing paragraphs, and refining sentences.  Writing tutors do not edit or proofread, instead they teach students how to do this for themselves.  The goal of the Writing Center is to teach writers to write effectively with clarity and confidence.  </p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Language Support for Multilingual Students</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">An English language specialist is available to provide semester-long or targeted <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/asc/multilingual-student-support/" target="_blank">support for multilingual students</a>  who have been referred by course faculty.  </p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Speaking Center</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Supporting St. Olaf College's mission to stimulate students' critical thinking and encourage them to be seekers of truth, the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/speakingcenter/" target="_blank">Speaking Center</a>  tutors help students to argue clearly and coherently in speech, to organize and develop thoughtful presentations of their work, to listen and respond to each other in discussion, and, in general, to develop the speaking skills that enable them to be responsible and knowledgeable citizens of the world.  </p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Disability and Access Center</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/asc/dac/" target="_blank">Disability and Access Center</a>  provides consultation and assistance for students with disabilities and resources for their faculty members.  Services include identifying barriers to access, determining and arranging for appropriate accommodations, including providing auxiliary aids, offering regular support and strategy instruction, and facilitating communication with faculty and staff.  </p>  <p class="body">ASC services are free of charge for St. Olaf students. </p>
 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="2" name="text">The Piper Center for Vocation and Career</h2> <p class="body">The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center for Vocation and Career</a>  is composed of five program areas offering a host of opportunities for students to discern their vocation and gain career-related experience while pursuing an undergraduate degree. Within each program are initiatives that promote the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center’s</a>  mission to “provide resources and experiences designed to help students leverage their liberal arts education to achieve their full potential.” The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a>  is a resource center for students, providing information and assistance to help determine vocational goals and devise well-informed post-graduation plans.</p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Career Education and Coaching</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Career coaches help students develop, implement, and evaluate career and life plans while collaborating with academic departments to integrate concepts of career development into courses of study. Career Education workshops and events are designed to help students identify their vocation and refine their professional skills. From vocational discernment exercises, to mock interviews and salary negotiation, <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a>  events and workshops provide the tools to guide students toward a meaningful career or post-graduate opportunity.</p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Internships, Service, and Leadership</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">These programs support students in applying classroom learning and developing professional skills. Students utilize services and resources available through the Internship program to identify and prepare for structured educational work experiences. <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a>  staff work closely with faculty members to develop tools and strategies that encourage students to set learning goals and derive meaning from their credit and non-credit internship experiences. The Civic Engagement program helps connect the classroom with the community – linking students with civic and service opportunities in local, domestic, and international contexts. Collaboration between the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a> , faculty members, and community partners enhances learning and encourages students to develop the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to become engaged citizens.</p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Recruiting and Outreach</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Throughout the year, students have the opportunity to interact with alumni and employers through on-campus and virtual recruiting, information sessions, job and internship fairs, and networking events. <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a>  staff facilitate numerous on- and off-campus career and networking events where students can take advantage of the vast network of St. Olaf alumni and other supporters living and working locally, domestically, and abroad.</p>  <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Innovation and Entrepreneurship</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">The Innovation and Entrepreneurship program promotes creativity among students, faculty, and alumni toward the goal of transforming society. Dedicated to education, research, and service within the liberal arts, the program supports student creativity through innovation grants, courses, internships, business plan development, start-up support, and networking events.</p> <h3 class="body" style="margin-left:40px">Postgraduate Scholarships and Fellowships</h3> <p class="body" style="margin-left:40px">In close collaboration with faculty and academic departments, the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/" target="_blank">Piper Center</a>  oversees the application process for students wishing to apply for <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/national-fellowship-opportunities/">nationally competitive fellowships requiring institutional endorsement </a> such as Fulbright, Marshall, Truman, Udall, Carnegie, and others. The assistant director of fellowships assists students with the discernment process, advises on best practices for assembling a competitive application, shepherds students through the on-campus nomination process, and works in conjunction with academic departments to assemble faculty panels designated to evaluate applicant candidacy for a variety of fellowships awards.</p> 
 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="3" name="text">Information Technology</h2> <p class="body"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/it/" target="_blank">Information Technology</a>  (IT) provides computers, software, A/V technologies, telecommunications, and support services to the entire St. Olaf community. All campus computers connect to the campus network, the Internet, and Internet 2.</p>  <p class="body">Public computing labs are located in all the academic buildings and residence halls. Nineteen departments share or have their own specialized computing labs. This brings the total number of computers available for student use to nearly 1100. Multimedia editing facilities are also available in Rølvaag Library and in the IT Media Lab. The Media Lab offers students the chance to work with video editing, web design, poster and 3D printing, and more.</p> <p class="body">Nearly all of the St. Olaf faculty rely on some form of computing technology in their teaching, be it podcasts, personal response systems, Moodle, or video production. All college classrooms are equipped with appropriate technologies.</p> <p class="body">Over 98 percent of all students have their own computer on campus. Students who own a computer can connect to the campus network and the Internet using either the wireless network or a wired connection. Wireless access is available across campus, including many outdoor spaces. Students can access their course assignments, check email, review their grades, view their tuition bills, stream videos, or just surf the web from the comfort of their rooms, the campus green, or from a study space just about anywhere on campus.</p> <p class="body">IT employs 30 full-time professionals and nearly 70 student employees who support the computing needs of the entire campus. A campus help desk and student computing consultants are available nearly 80 hours per week during the academic year, including assistance in the evenings. </p>
 <h2 class="goldhead" headerid="4" name="text">St. Olaf’s Libraries and Special Collections</h2> <p class="body">The St. Olaf Libraries provide a variety of carefully selected resources that mirror the breadth and depth of the undergraduate curriculum. These resources are housed in three branches: Rølvaag Library (the &quot;main&quot; library), Halvorson Music Library, and Hustad Science Library. The libraries subscribe to thousands of print and electronic periodicals, core disciplinary journals, and hundreds of scholarly online databases and archival collections to support academic and curricular research.</p> <p class="body">The strength of the St. Olaf collection is magnified through our partnership with the Carleton College Library via the Bridge consortium which offers a joint catalog of over 1.3 million items, including physical and online video and audio recordings and digital resources. In addition, both schools have recently implemented Bridge², a web discovery tool that provides access to over a billion regional, national, and international academic resources. Strong relationships with national library consortia provide extensive delivery of items via interlibrary-loan.</p> <p class="body">While the Bridge consortium provides the fundamental resources for undergraduate research, it also has a number of unusual strengths. St. Olaf College has especially strong holdings in the fields of music, Nordic history and literature, and Norwegian-American culture and church life. The St. Olaf Libraries digitize, and make freely available, unique local publications such as the <em>Manitou Messenger</em>, the <em>Viking Yearbook</em>, and other works of historical significance to St. Olaf College.</p> <p class="body">The St. Olaf Libraries offer a course-integrated instruction program that teaches students to conduct research in a wide range of disciplines. In a typical academic week, the libraries provide 60 hours of research assistance at the reference desk. The libraries are open 110 hours per week when class is in session, with extended hours late in the semester and during exams. Twenty-six staff and more than 100 students purchase, organize, and provide access to a rich blend of materials and service points.</p> <h3 class="subhead">Kierkegaard Library</h3> <p class="body">The Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library, located within the Rølvaag Library building, is the major research collection outside of Denmark for the study of the thought of the Danish philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. The library was presented to St. Olaf College in 1976 by the Hongs, who gathered the collection to support their translation into English of the complete works of Kierkegaard, published in 26 volumes by Princeton University Press. The Library is directed by Professor Gordon Marino, a Kierkegaard specialist and professor in the Philosophy Department. Especially during the summer, the library offers programs that bring students and visiting scholars together for research seminars and private study as well as study of Danish for the purpose of reading Kierkegaard texts in the original language. More than 50 scholars a year come to the Library from all over the U.S. and around the world. The collection includes 12,000 book volumes as well as 5,000 periodical and newspaper articles, non-print media, and archival materials. The collection is open Monday-Friday 9:00 a.m-5:00 p.m. during the academic year, with extended hours in the summer months. Access to the collection at other times is available by appointment. The collection is open to anyone with interest in the study of Søren Kierkegaard, including St. Olaf and Carleton students, faculty, scholars, pastors, and other visitors. For further information, consult the Kierkegaard Library website at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/kierkegaard/" target="_blank">wp.stolaf.edu/kierkegaard</a> .</p>  <h3 class="subhead">College Archives</h3> <p class="body">Located in the Rølvaag Library Building, the Shaw-Olson Center for College History contains official records and publications, private papers, photographs, books, periodicals, audio and visual recordings, and museum artifacts that record and illustrate the history and life of the college. These materials provide historical information about the Board of Regents, the faculty, the student body, alumni, academic departments, the curriculum, administrative offices, campus services, college organizations, and campus activities. The mission of the archives is:</p> <ol> 	<li class="body">to preserve materials that reflect the college’s identity;</li> 	<li class="body">to make these materials available to scholars, students, alumni, and other interested researchers; and</li> 	<li class="body">to promote attention to the college's history.</li> </ol> <p class="body">The collection may be searched electronically with <em>Fram</em> at <a href="http://fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/" target="_blank">fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/</a> . <em>Fram</em> identifies paper records and artifacts, indexes abstracts of all articles in the student newspaper, <em><a href="http://www.manitoumessenger.com/" target="_blank">The Manitou Messenger</a> </em> , and provides full text searching for the St. Olaf magazine. The Center for College History also provides work opportunities for some students and occasional internships for majors in appropriate departments and programs.</p>  <h3 class="subhead">The Norwegian-American Historical Association</h3> <p class="body">Housed in the Rølvaag Library Building, the Norwegian-American Historical Association (NAHA) has been sheltered by St. Olaf since its founding in 1925. With an international membership of over 1,000, NAHA has two goals: to publish scholarly books on Norwegian-American history (106 books have been published so far) and to be a national center for research in Norwegian-American history by collecting and maintaining printed and manuscript materials produced by Norwegian-Americans or concerning their history. Printed materials, including periodicals and newspapers, are incorporated in the college library collection and other materials (such as diaries, journals, photographs, and records of organizations) in a separate archive. The oldest, out-of-print publications are available on the NAHA website at: <em><a href="http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/" target="_blank">www.naha.stolaf.edu</a> .</em>  Both students and the public are invited to use this center for research in Norwegian migration.</p> 
 <h2 class="coursename" headerid="5" name="text"><span class="goldhead">TRIO Student Support Services</span> <span class="goldsubhead">(SSS</span><span class="goldsubhead">)</span></h2> <p class="coursename">507-786-8018 • <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/sss/" target="_blank"><span class="goldsubhead">http://wp.stolaf.edu/sss/</span></a> </p>  <p class="body">Student Support Services (SSS) is a student retention program sponsored by St. Olaf College with substantial support from the U.S. Department of Education, the National Science Foundation Northstar STEM Alliance, Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and the Hearst Foundations. The SSS program is one of three TRIO programs originally funded under the Higher Education Act of 1965, whose objective is to help students overcome class, social, and cultural barriers to complete their college education. SSS provides the following services: summer bridge program, academic advising/referral; cultural events and leadership activities; financial aid and financial literacy advising; graduate school preparation; research, internship and scholarship application assistance; Supplemental Instruction (SI); and a graphing calculator and textbook lending program.</p> <p class="body">To be eligible for services, a participant must be: a first-generation college student (neither parent has a four-year bachelor's degree), meet federal income guidelines, and/or have a documented disability; a U.S. citizen or meet residency requirements for federal student financial assistance; and be enrolled at St. Olaf College. The SSS program provides services to approximately 160 eligible St. Olaf students annually. In<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/sss/files/2013/05/SSSApplication.doc"> </a> order to apply for the program, students should complete an <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/sss/files/2013/05/SSSApplication.doc">application</a>  and bring it to the Student Support Services Office in Tomson Hall 282.</p> 
<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="6" name="text">Other Academic Support</h2>
<h3 class="subhead">Class Attendance</h3>
<p class="body">Class attendance is expected and usually required. Irregular class attendance becomes the concern of the college since absence from class represents an academic loss. Excessive or prolonged absences are reported by instructors to the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/deanofstudents/" target="_blank">Dean of Students Office</a>
.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">Study Time and Study Habits</h3>
<p class="body">Many students need to adjust their time use habits on arrival at college. St. Olaf students are expected to devote a minimum of three hours of study outside of class for each hour in class. Making the best use of the limited time available usually requires using a good mix of daylight and evening hours for studying and avoiding study marathons. Successful study at St. Olaf usually includes reading ahead, attending class, using faculty office hours, studying for each class in frequent, short study sessions, attending help sessions, forming a study group, asking questions soon after they arise, and seeking help if the preceding efforts do not appear to be working.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Faculty Office Hours</h3>
<p class="body">Professors hold office hours for the classes they teach. Office hours are regular times set aside each week to talk with students from class, usually on a walk-in basis. Office hours provide an opportunity to ask questions about class topics, to extend the class discussion, or to get to know instructors better. St. Olaf faculty encourage students to avail themselves of this opportunity.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Help Sessions</h3>
<p class="body">Many departments hold special help sessions or discussion groups for particular courses. These are usually listed on syllabi for those courses and are usually staffed with upperclass students who have been successful in the course. These sessions may offer an opportunity to get a second look at the class material, to rehearse the ideas and vocabulary, and to ask questions.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Study Groups</h3>
<p class="body">Most students find it helpful in at least some of their courses to form a study group of two to three interested classmates. Such groups often improve understanding of course material through discussing assignments, exploring course ideas further, brainstorming possible test questions for each other, or formulating questions to bring up in class.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Continuous Reporting System</h3>
<p class="body">Instructors are required to file a continuous reporting form that alerts the Dean of Students Office to students who are having difficulties in a course.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
