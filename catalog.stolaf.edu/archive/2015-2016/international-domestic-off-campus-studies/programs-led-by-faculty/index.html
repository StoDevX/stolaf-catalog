<div id="textcontainer" class="tab_content">

	<div id="deptcontacts">





	</div>
<p class="body">St. Olaf faculty members organize and lead semester programs that range in length from four to five months and cover a wide variety of subjects. Two programs are offered annually during fall semester (one continuing through the January Interim), a third is offered every other year during the spring semester.  See International and Off-Campus Studies <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/international/" target="_blank">Web site</a>
 for course details and general education requirements that the courses fulfill.</p>

<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="1" name="text">Mediterranean Semester (Fall Semester)</h2>
<p>The Mediterranean Semester examines the continuous interaction of several major civilizations around the rim of the Mediterranean Sea.  The program investigates the historical development of three countries/regions and current changes going on in each of them.  Throughout the semester, students encounter numerous ethnic and religious communities and the interplay between European and Middle Eastern influences.  The program begins in Turkey, which is a connecting point between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The former Ottoman Empire based in Turkey influenced all of the other regions visited during this program.  The program continues in Morocco, which shares much religiously and culturally with other countries in the Middle East but was also influenced by Europe during the period of colonialism.  The program will finish with an interdisciplinary course based in Jerusalem where Judaism, Christianity, and Islam co-exist. </p>
<p>The program offers students three courses of study taught in affiliation with local educational institutions.  The St. Olaf field supervisor provides a fourth course that runs concurrently with the others. Extensive excursions to sites in each of the countries are integrated into the courses of study.</p>
<p class="body"><strong>Note that Mediterranean Semester will not be offered in Fall 2015.</strong></p>
<p class="body">Political Science ME 254:  Political Institutions of the Middle East<br/>
This course examines social changes and political developments in the Middle East and their impact on emerging political institutions. It includes study of Islam and its relation to political institutions and the special role of Turkey in Middle Eastern affairs and in relation to Europe and the United States. The prospects for peaceful resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict are also discussed. (Bogazici University).  Counts toward major: Political Science.</p>
<p class="body">Sociology ME 257: Social Change in Moroccan Society<br/>

<p class="body">Interdisciplinary ME255: History, Religion and Politics in the Palestine-Israel Conflict<br/>
This course provides a historical overview of religion, colonialism, and imperialism in the Middle East and considers implications for the Palestine-Israel conflict.  Covering a broad range of historical periods and political events, the course surveys the role of religion in the domestic contexts of Palestine and Israel and reveals how world politics and powers have shaped the conflict until today, with particular focus on Jerusalem.  Counts toward concentration: Middle Eastern Studies.</p>
<p class="body">Field Supervisor's Course - changes annually.  Program not offered in Fall 2015.</p>
<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="2" name="text">The Global Semester (Fall Semester and Interim)</h2>
<p class="body">The Global Semester is a five-month academic program offering five courses in different parts of the world.  Courses are designed to enable students to develop windows on the world from distinct academic perspectives through class lectures, field trips, and other activities. The program aims to facilitate immersion in the daily life of each community and develop comparisons with American society. Students are encouraged to incorporate a global view into their liberal arts study of what it means to be a citizen of the world.</p>
<p class="body">The itinerary takes the group around the world with visits to Greece, Egypt, India, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, and South Korea. The academic program focuses for one month on each of four countries: Egypt, India, Hong Kong, and South Korea. In cooperation with coordinators in each of the four countries and in association with staff members of  the American University in Cairo, the Ecumenical Christian Centre (Bangalore, India), Chinese University of Hong Kong and Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea), students study Egyptian history, religions of South Asia, Chinese art and Korean society.</p>
<p class="body">History GL 257: Themes in Ancient Graeco-Roman and Islamic-Egyptian History<br/>
Lectures, discussions, and extensive field trips provide understanding of significant developments and themes in Egypt’s ancient and medieval past with emphasis on dynastic Coptic and Islamic periods. Field trips include a visit to Luxor. Counts toward major.<br/>
NOTE:  Should political developments necessitate, the time in Egypt would be shifted to an alternate location.<br/>
 <br/>
Religion GL 251: Religions of India<br/>
Lectures, discussions, and field trips provide the basis for an understanding of the history and practice of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and other religions in India. Religious scholars from India provide the background for an understanding of the assumptions, views, nature, traditions, and contemporary practices of the dominant religious expressions in India. Counts toward major.<br/>
 <br/>
Art GL 241: The Arts of China<br/>
Survey of Chinese art, its function, technique, and aesthetic elements from bronzes and oracle bones of the Shang Dynasty to porcelain and scroll paintings of the Ching Dynasty. Counts toward major.<br/>
 <br/>
Sociology GL 255: Korean Society<br/>
Introduction to the social structure and institutions of contemporary South Korea, including population, urbanization, social class and mobility, work organizations and labor relations, family, and women. Counts toward major.</p>
<p class="body"><strong>Field Supervisor’s course 2015:  </strong><strong>Chemistry 150: Molecular Gastronomy</strong> <br/>
This interdisciplinary course takes a scientific approach to understanding the sensory perception of flavor by beginning with an exploration into the molecules that impart flavor to cuisine, followed by study of how these molecules and regionally specific pairings of ingredients create biochemical responses in the mouth and nose.  Finally, the course covers how the biochemical responses are carried to the brain where they are translated into the perceived flavor.  Exploration and discussion centers on the authentic foods and flavors of the regions visited.</p>
<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="3" name="text">Environmental Science in Australia (Spring Semester)</h2>
<p class="body"><strong>Note: Normally offered every other year. Offered in Spring 2016.</strong></p>
<p class="body">The flora, fauna, ecological habitats, and human history of Australia offer opportunities for study that are unique in diversity. This program will start in Melbourne during Australia’s late summer and move northward into the warmer latitudes during the semester as the fall season progresses. All travel will be in the eastern third of the country where the greatest diversity of natural habitats and human activity occur. A combination of lectures, extensive field experiences, and brief research projects will enable students to learn about and appreciate this fascinating continent. Students considering this program should be aware that it has a demanding physical schedule and moves frequently to new locations.</p>
<p class="body">Biology 224: Marine Biology<br/>
Field trips will explore many habitats from mud flats to coral reefs. Studies will occur at several marine research facilities located throughout the Southern Ocean and Pacific Ocean. At least one week will be spent at the Heron Island Research Station on the Great Barrier Reef. Participants will begin to appreciate the unique diversity of marine organisms and habitats, why we should be concerned about them, what factors threaten the survivial of species and policies that influence how we can conserve them.<br/>
 <br/>
Biology 226: Terrestrial Ecology<br/>
Course will examine organism-environment interactions and the study of populations and biological communities across Eastern Australia's diverse terrestrial ecosystems from coastal sand dunes to subtropical rain forests as well as the dry outback. Field trips will include two week-long camping trips in remote areas. Studies will occur at many national parks and involve hands-on project planning, data collection and scientific presentations. Participants will begin to appreciate the unique diversity of terrestrial organisms and habitats, pressures from the biotic and abiotic environment that bring about change in biological communities, and how ecological research and inquiry connects to conservation and/or preservation efforts.<br/>
 <br/>
Sociology/Anthropology 222: Cultural Anthropology:<br/>
Course features ethnography as a means to gain insight into the ways of life and culture structrues in Austalia as well as provide an introduction to the traditional and contemporary cultures of indigenous peoples. Course will visit both rural and urban aboriginal communities as well as significant aboriginal sites. Students will explore the juxtaposition of museum holdings with historic and contemporary aboriginal cultures. Special attention will be given to the European impact on the Aborigines and the influence of cultural meanings on the Australian environment over the last 200 years.<br/>
 <br/>
Political Science 221: Environmental Policy:<br/>
Course will study Australia's governmental structure, political parties, and civic expectations about the role of government as it relates to the making and enforcement of environmental policy and practice. Comparisons and contrasts between the USA and Australia provide opportunities to gain insight between various approaches to environmental challenges and solutions.  The historic contexts of European colonization, immigration, and displacement of the Aboriginal Peoples expose continuing cultural challenges in both environmental and social domains.  One focal point for this class will be visits to state and/or federal capitals, including Parliament. Topics will range from the roles of local, regional, and national governments to the activities of NGOs to mineral resources to the Great Barrier Reef.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
