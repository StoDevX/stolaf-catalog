            <p class="programname">Financial Aid Program</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/financialaid/%20">http://www.stolaf.edu/services/financialaid/ </a></p>
            <p><em>The financial aid program at St. Olaf College has one primary objective: to make it possible for qualified young men and women to obtain an education at St. Olaf. The college operates on the premise that all students admitted to St. Olaf and in good academic standing are wor-thy of financial assistance to attend St. Olaf if financial need is demonstrated. </em></p>
            <p><em>The responsibility for financing a St. Olaf education rests first with the student and his or her family. All new students who wish to apply for financial aid must complete the College Scholarship Service (CSS) PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Returning students must complete the FAFSA and the St. Olaf Application for Financial Aid. Using a standardized formula, these documents generate, on the basis of the family&rsquo;s financial situation, the amount of the student&rsquo;s annual educational expenses the family is expected to meet. That amount is the &ldquo;expected family contribution.&rdquo; </em></p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;Demonstrated need&rdquo; is the difference between the annual educational expenses at St. Olaf College and the expected family contribution. Demonstrated need is the basis on which St. Olaf financial aid is awarded. The college will provide each student with a finan-cial aid package of scholarship, grants, loans, and/or student work to meet 100 percent of the demonstrated need. </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">STUDENT FINANCIAL AID</p>
            <p class="body">Only full-time students who are degree candidates at St. Olaf College in their first eight semesters are eligible for financial assistance from the college. Students enrolled for a ninth or tenth semester are not eligible for most grant programs and will have larger loan components in a fifth year of enrollment. </p>
            <p>Financial aid is credited directly to the student&rsquo;s comprehensive fee account. Financial aid is credited on an equal basis for the Fall Semester and the Spring Semester. </p>
            <p>Students on academic probation may not be eligible to receive scholarship assistance from St. Olaf or federal or state financial aid during the probationary period. </p>
            <p>Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs. For more information on SAP policies at St. Olaf, contact the Office of Financial Aid. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">THE ENDOWMENT ADVANTAGE </p>
            <p class="body">The endowment at St. Olaf (which had a market value of over $225 million in 2005) consists of funds contributed to St. Olaf by alumni, parents, faculty, staff, corporations, foundations, and other friends of the college. The income from those contributions is applied to &mdash; among other programs &mdash; grants, scholarships, and faculty research and travel. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the endowment and other annual financial support, every student attending St. Olaf &mdash; whether receiving financial aid or not &mdash; benefits from an indirect form of financial assistance. Endowment earnings and annual gifts help support the operating budget of the college and allow St. Olaf to keep tuition charges at roughly 75 percent of the actual cost. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SCHOLARSHIPS </p>
            <p class="body">St. Olaf scholarships are available to incoming first-year students, transfers, and returning students. Eligibility for a St. Olaf scholarship is based on demonstrated need, other financial aid, scholastic standing, activity record, test scores, recommendations, and full-time enrollment. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>National Merit Scholarships:</strong> Applicants who have designated St. Olaf College as their first-choice college with the National Merit Scholarship Corporation are eligible for the St. Olaf National Merit Scholarship award. St. Olaf sponsors up to 40 Merit Scholarships each year for incoming students. The minimum annual award is $7,500. </p>
            <p><strong>Other Merit-Based Scholarships:</strong> St. Olaf also awards scholarships through programs such as the Buntrock Academic Scholarship and the Award for Service and Leadership. For information on how to apply for these programs, please contact the Office of Admission at 507-786-3025 or 800-800-3025, or e-mail to <em><a href="mailto:admissions@stolaf.edu">admissions@stolaf.edu</a>. </em></p>
            <p>Buntrock Academic Scholarships range from $3,000 to $11,000 per year. The awards are renewable for each of the recipient&rsquo;s four years at St. Olaf. </p>
            <p>Many schools that offer merit and talent scholarships prescribe strict criteria with respect to a high school G.P.A., test scores, class rank, etc. We have found that such prescriptions often discourage very successful students from competing. As such, we are inclined to respect the differences among high schools and not list a set of minimum criteria for scholarship candidates. </p>
            <p>Eligibility for Buntrock awards is based primarily on academic performance in high school, and the selection is highly competitive. Past recipients have generally presented a high school G.P.A. of 3.6 or higher and are often in the top five percent of their high school graduating class. Evidence of participa-tion in extracurricular activities in addition to academic performance is valued. </p>
            <p>Recipients of Buntrock awards may be designated a Regents Scholar or a Presidential Scholar. Up to 70 students will be selected as finalists for the Regents award &mdash; our top academic scholarship &mdash; and are invited to campus for a series of programs and faculty interviews in March. </p>
            <p>Candidates who are not selected to interview on campus will automatically be considered for a presidential or deans&rsquo; award and will be notified of the committee&rsquo;s decision in mid-March. </p>
            <p>In addition to completing a St. Olaf application for admission, candidates must complete and return the Buntrock academic scholarship application no later than February 1 of the senior year. Candidates who wish to be considered for the Buntrock Regent scholarship must apply under Early Action, com-pleting their application no later than December 1 of the senior year. </p>
            <p>The St. Olaf Awards for Service and Leadership recognize the talents and abilities of those students who have given significant time and effort for the benefit of others. Students who have been involved in community service activities, either on a personal level or as part of a larger group, are encouraged to apply for this service award. Applicants for this award should have a complete St. Olaf Application for Admission and a St. Olaf Award for Service and Leadership application on file by February 1 of the senior year. In addition, applicants are encouraged to submit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; detailing their community service involvement, including types of activities and length of service.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">GRANTS </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>The STEP Program:</strong> The St. Olaf Education Partnership (STEP) provides up to $1,000 per year per stu-dent as a match to scholarships given by Lutheran congregations to their members attending St. Olaf. </p>
            <p><strong>The Federal Pell Grant</strong> is a federally-based program with awards ranging from $400 to $4,050. The amount of the award is determined by the federal government. </p>
            <p><strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG):</strong> FSEOG is a federally-funded program for students with financial need. The amount of the award &mdash; up to $4,000 per year &mdash; is determined by the Office of Financial Aid. </p>
            <p><strong>Minnesota State Grant</strong> is a program limited to students who are graduates of a Minnesota high school or whose parents currently reside in Minnesota. Awards, ranging to $8,202 per year, are determined by the Minnesota Higher Education Services Office. </p>
            <p align="left">For state grant purposes, full-time is defined as at least 3.75 courses per semester, or 2.75 courses one semester, an Interim course, and 3.75 courses in the other semester. Students who are enrolled in fewer hours during the school year will experience significant reductions in State Grant amounts. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">LOANS </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Federal Perkins Loan Program:</strong> Long-term loans for students who demonstrate financial need are avail-able through the federal Perkins loan program. The amounts vary, but cannot exceed $3,500 per year. </p>
            <p>No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled as at least a half-time student. Simple interest of 5% and repayment begin nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than half-time. Repayment must be completed within 10 years. </p>
            <p><strong>Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized):</strong> Many families qualify for a subsidized federal Stafford loan, which can provide up to $2,625 per year for first-year students, $3,500 for second-year stu-dents and up to $5,500 for third- and fourth-year students. </p>
            <p>Eligibility is based on demonstrated need. Factors such as the number of persons in the family and the number of children in college affect eligibility. </p>
            <p>Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized) and (Unsubsidized) can be secured from banks and savings and loan associations. Applications may be obtained from private lenders or from the St. Olaf financial aid office. A student may borrow up to $23,000 in Stafford loans as an undergraduate. Stafford loans are subject to a 3% origination fee and a 1% guarantee fee, although many lenders will pay the guarantee fee for the student borrowers. </p>
            <p>For a subsidized Stafford loan, the federal government pays the interest during the in-school period. Beginning July 1, 2006, the interest for an unsubsidized Stafford loan is fixed at 6.8% during the in-school period. </p>
            <p>During repayment, the interest rate for both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans borrowed prior to July 1, 2006, is at a rate equal&nbsp; to the 91-day T-bill rate plus 2.3% (7.14% as of July 2006), with a maximum of 8.25%. For loans borrowed after July 1, 2006, the rate will be fixed at 6.8%. </p>
            <p>Repayment begins six months after a student ceases to be at least a half-time student and is normally completed according to a 10-year amortization schedule. For those students who borrow about $4,000 or less, minimum monthly payments of $50 will be required but will result in a repayment period shorter than 10 years. </p>
            <p><strong>Student Educational Loan Fund (SELF):</strong> Student educational loans are available to St. Olaf students irrespective of need. Effective July 1, 2006, the maximum SELF loan is $6,000 per year for first- and second-year students and $7,500 for third- and fourth-year students. These loans, made available by the Minnesota Higher Education Services Office (MHESO), carry a variable interest rate (generally 6-8%). Interest is charged and paid quarterly during &ldquo;in-school&rdquo; periods. Monthly &ldquo;interest-only&rdquo; payments are expected in the first year following the completion of a student&rsquo;s schooling. Monthly payments toward interest and principal begin on the first anniversary of the completion of school. </p>
            <p><strong>Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS):</strong> Parent loan for undergraduate students (PLUS) is a program open to the parents of all St. Olaf students. PLUS funds can be secured from banks and from savings and loan associations. Applications are available from participating lenders. The PLUS program is guaranteed by the federal government and is insured against the death of the borrower. </p>
            <p>Parents may borrow up to the cost of education minus financial aid received. The interest rate on PLUS borrowed prior to July 1, 2006, is at a rate equal to the 91-day T-bill rate plus 3.1% (7.94% as of July 2006), with a cap of 9%. For loans borrowed after July 1, 2006, the rate will be fixed at 8.5%. PLUS loans are subject to up to a 4% origination fee and guarantee fee. Repayment on PLUS loans begins within 60 days after receipt of loan proceeds and can be extended over 10 years. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">STUDENT WORK </p>
            <p class="body">More than one-half of the students at St. Olaf work on campus part-time. </p>
            <p>Need-based, part-time work on campus traditionally has offered students the opportunity to help defray their college expenses and gain useful work experience. Recognizing that many people value the chance to contribute to their education, the college attempts to make student work opportunities available to every St. Olaf student who wishes to work. Priority will continue to be given, however, to those students who demonstrate financial need and receive student work as a component of their financial aid award. </p>
            <p>Students are paid a wage of $7.15 per hour or more, depending on the job. The maximum yearly contract of about $2,300 for no more than 10 hours of work per week is not a guarantee that a student will earn a specified amount through campus employment.
