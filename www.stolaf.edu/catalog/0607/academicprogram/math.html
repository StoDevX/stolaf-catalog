                <p> <span class="programdescription">Mathematics,  as the study of patterns and order, is a creative art, a language, and  a science. The practice of mathematics combines the aesthetic appeal of  creating patterns of ideas with the utilitarian appeal of applications  of these same ideas. As the language of physical science, mathematics  is also used increasingly to model phenomena in the biological and  social sciences. Mathematical literacy is indispensable in today&rsquo;s society. As part of the Department of Mathematics,  Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS), members of the mathematics  faculty strive to help students understand natural connections among  these related but distinct disciplines. </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Mathematics  at St. Olaf is interesting, exciting, accessible, and an appropriate  area of study for all students. Each year, seven to ten percent of  graduating seniors complete mathematics  majors. The department offers courses representing various mathematical  perspectives: theoretical and applied, discrete and continuous,  algebraic and geometric, and more. Our faculty also teach courses in  statistics, computer science, and mathematics education. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> A  concentration in statistics and a major in computer science are also  available. Courses in these areas are taught by faculty from the  Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. For further information on these, consult the separate listings under <a href="statistics.html">STATISTICS</a> and <a href="comp-sci.html">COMPUTER SCIENCE</a>. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
                <p> Students  arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized  Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent  program of study consistent with the goals of the individual student.  The courses included in a student&rsquo;s IMaP are determined after  consultation with an MSCS faculty member and approved by the department  chair. </p>
                <p> A path through the major as described by a student&rsquo;s IMaP normally includes two semesters of calculus,  one semester of linear algebra, and at least seven intermediate or  advanced mathematics courses. The intermediate courses should include  two transition courses (from among Math 244, Math 252, and Math 242)  and courses from at least three different mathematical perspectives  (computation/modeling, continuous/analytic,  discrete/combinatorial, axiomatic/algebraic). Students must take at  least two Level III courses, at least one of which must be part of a  designated Level II&ndash;Level III sequence. </p>
                <p> An IMaP may include up to two related courses from Statistics or Computer Science; a current listing  of such courses is available on the mathematics web page. A student may  also find a course outside of MSCS that contributes significantly to a  mathematical path of study and may petition to have the course included  in his or her IMaP. </p>
                <p> Mathematics  majors who intend to teach grades 5-12 mathematics must meet the above  requirements (see also EDUCATION description and the Mathematics  Licensure Adviser). Their IMaPs must include Mathematics 232, 244, 252,  262, and 356, a course in statistics, and Education 350 in order to  meet the State of Minnesota licensure requirements. Students wishing to  add grades 5-8 mathematics licensure to a non-mathematics teaching  major should also submit an IMaP. Course requirements include calculus,  linear algebra, discrete mathematics, statistics, geometry, and a  course in the nature of mathematics, as well as Education 350. </p>
                <p> Students should consult the mathematics program web page (www.stolaf.edu/depts/math) for lists of courses that satisfy each perspective, lists of sequence courses, and other useful information. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES </h5>
                <p> Mathematical  experiences inside and outside the classroom are important parts of an  IMaP. Following are some of the many possibilities. For more  information consult the mathematics program web page or a faculty member. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Research: An invigorating way to explore mathematics, research opportunities exist both on- and off-campus. </li>
                  <li> Experiential  learning: The Mathematics Practicum (Mathematics 390), internships,  independent studies and other courses provide other valuable  opportunities to apply mathematical knowledge beyond the classroom. </li>
                  <li> Study abroad: The IMaP&rsquo;s flexibility allows study abroad programs to fit well into a student&rsquo;s mathematics  major. Students interested in a program focused on upper-level  mathematics should consider the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics. </li>
                  <li> Problem solving and competitions: The department supervises a problem-solving seminar and sponsors  student participation in regional and national competitions. St. Olaf  also hosts its own annual mathematics competition, the Carlson  Contests. </li>
                  <li> Mathematical Association of America: The department has an active student chapter of this national organization. </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION IN MATHEMATICS </h5>
                <p> Information about distinction, awarded for distinguished work that goes beyond the minimum requirements for the major, is available in the MSCS department and on the mathematics website. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY </h5>
                <p> Students  planning graduate work in the mathematical sciences should pursue  opportunities that add both depth and breadth to their majors. Courses  across a broad range of the curriculum will help students prepare for the Mathematics Graduate Record Exam. Taking many Level III courses will help students prepare  for their first year of graduate school. Research experiences (on- or  off-campus) and independent studies will help students learn whether or  not they are truly interested in further mathematical studies. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
