            <div>
              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/philosophy/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/philosophy/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Corliss Swain, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, Hume, value theory </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Karen Gervais, biomedical ethics, ethics and health policy, philosophy of law, social and political philosophy, feminist philosophy; Jeanine Grenberg, ethics, Kant, history of modern phi-losophy; Vicki Lynn Harper, ancient Greek philosophy, logic, ethics; Toben Lafran&ccedil;ois, philosophy of science, environmental ethics; Edward Langerak, ethics, Kant, social and political philosophy; Jennifer Manion, moral philosophy, social and political philosophy, feminist theory, gender/sexuality studies; Gor-don Marino, Kierkegaard, existentialism, ancient Greek philosophy; Anthony Rudd, Kierkegaard, episte-mology, philosophy of mind, ethics, history of philosophy; Edmund Santurri, ethics, aesthetics, philoso-phy of religion, political philosophy; Charles Taliaferro, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, ethics </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  aim of the Philosophy Department is to engage students in disciplined  and imaginative thinking about philosophical issues. Philosophical  questions fall primarily into four groups: questions about the nature  of reality (metaphysics), about reasoning and inference (logic), about  knowledge (epistemology), and about values and society, including moral  values (ethics) and aesthetic values. These questions, which arise  naturally in the course of a liberal education, are not only  fascinating in their own right, they also touch on issues central to  understanding and improving human life in our own society and in the  world. Because they involve complex and controversial issues, there are  no easy answers. Yet it matters greatly which answers are accepted, and  it is therefore important to engage in discussion with others who face  these questions and to seek to learn from the philosophers of the past  and present. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Engaging  in philosophy develops skills in careful and fair-minded  interpretation, creative but rigorous argumentation, and perceptive,  wise evaluation of complex issues. These valu-able  abilities are applicable to any subject matter and in any human context  and are useful for negotiating the ambiguities of today&rsquo;s career paths. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students  can find philosophy courses that satisfy each of the six categories of  core general education requirements. Also, a significant number of the  courses that satisfy the EIN requirement are taught by philosophers. In  the philosophy common room and on the depart-ment&rsquo;s  website, the department provides for each term a prospectus that  describes the special focus and the expected reading and writing for  each course and section. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  major in philosophy is highly recommended not only for those who wish  to pursue graduate study in philosophy but also as preparation for  other careers that require the ability to think in a creative and dis-ciplined  manner about questions that are new or whose method of solution is  debated, including careers in law, theology, business, management,  medicine, journalism, politics, and education. </p>
              <p> Philosophy majors are encouraged to participate in the student-run Philosophy Forum, to attend sp-cial lectures and events sponsored by the department, to explore study abroad programs, and to participate in departmental social events. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  major in philosophy may be attained by completing the requirements for  either a regular major or a contract major. Most philosophy courses  simultaneously count toward the major and toward one or more general  education requirements. Because the philosophy major can be tailored to  the needs and goals of individual students, all philosophy majors are  encouraged to work closely with an advisor in the philosophy department. </p>
              <p> A regular major requires at least nine courses in philosophy, including Philosophy 235 (Ancient Philosophy),  Philosophy 236 (History of Modern Philosophy), Philosophy 240 (Formal  Logic), and three Level III seminar courses. These specifications seek  to first assure a major&rsquo;s grasp of the history and meth-ods of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical inquiry. </p>
              <p> A contract major involves a contract drawn up between the student and the Department of Philoso-phy.  The contract combines seven courses in philosophy, including Philosophy  235 and 236, two Level III seminar courses, and either a logic project  or Philosophy 240, with three Level II or III courses in another  department chosen to complement the work in philosophy. </p>
              <p> These  requirements give students a great deal of leeway to pursue their own  interests. Those who wish to develop a balanced understanding of  philosophy should take a number of courses in each of the fol-lowing categories: I. history of philosophy (118-intensive, 233, 235, 236, 251, 374); II. metaphysics and epistemology (231, 240, 241, 244, 371, 372); and III. ethics and value theory (119,  120, 147, 153, 243, 245, 250, 252, 254, 256, 257, 261, 373). Categories  for 375 and 399 vary year by year. It is also possi-ble to specialize in one of these areas, but students are strongly encouraged to take at least one, and prefer-ably two, courses in each of the areas outside their specialization. </p>
              <p> Students who complete the Great Conversation receive credit for one philosophy course toward the major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Departmental distinction in philosophy is awarded by a vote of the department to those graduating stu-dents  whose discourse, both oral and written, shows excellence in such  philosophical virtues as clarity, coherence, cogency, sensitivity to  the full range of relevant considerations, fair-mindedness, rigor,  creativity, and imagination. Candidates submit a portfolio of papers by April 15 to the department chair. Additional information about applying for distinction is available on the department&rsquo;s website and in the philosophy common room. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL RESOURCES </h5>
              <p> The  Howard and Edna Hong Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf is an  internationally acclaimed center for the study of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard,  the 19th-century Danish philosopher who is widely recognized as the  father of existentialism. The library offers a visiting fellows  program, and every year scholars from around the world come to do  research. It is an invaluable resource for students. A number of  philosophy students have worked in the library, and seniors and recent  graduates have participated in its fellowship program. The library  sponsors The Reed, an undergraduate journal of existential thought. </p>
              <p> The  Eunice Belgum Memorial Lectures are delivered annually by leading  philosophers from around the world. Recent lecturers include Bas van  Fraassen of Princeton University and Jonathan Lear of the University of  Chicago. The Belgum lecturer for 2006-07 is Galen Strawson from the  University of Read-ing and CUNY. Julia Anna (University of Arizona) is scheduled for 2007-08. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"> General Education 111 First-Year Writing</p>
              <p> First-year writing courses are sometimes taught by philosophers. Consult the General Education 111 prospectus for details. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 118 The Making of the Modern Mind </p>
              <p> This course examines historically significant conceptions of reality and knowledge focusing on philoso-phy&rsquo;s  contributions to Western culture. Major philosophers from ancient,  medieval, and modern Western philosophy are introduced and assessed for  their contributions to our understanding of the universe, human nature,  and values. Some sections offer a survey of Western philosophy; others  stress intensive study of central figures and works. Consult  departmental prospectus for details. Open to first-year stu-dents and sophomores only. Offered both semesters. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 119 Moral Psychology </p>
              <p> This  seminar provides an introduction to philosophy that focuses on  psychological issues related to moral behavior. The course examines the  nature of those states of mind that are thought to constitute moral (or  evil) character and produce moral (or evil) actions, relationships, and  societies. States considered may include humility, self-respect,  benificence, compassion, caring, anger, forgiveness, courage, and  truthful-ness. Open to first-year students and sophomores only. Offered most years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 120 Philosophy in Literature </p>
              <p> Literature  provides rich resources for thinking through central philosophical  questions, including the metaphysics and ethics of freedom, the problem  of evil, the role of character in choice and action, the nature of  morality, rebellion and human solidarity, God&rsquo;s existence and relation  to the world, and the nature of truth. This course explores  philosophical ideas in literary works of several different genres by  studying plot, character, point of view, imagery, and symbolism.  Offered only during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 147 Death and the Meaning of Life </p>
              <p> This  course introduces philosophical ideas and methods through reading,  discussing, and writing about basic questions that arise when we  reflect on the human condition. What is meant by &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; when one  asks whether (a person&rsquo;s) life has meaning? How do our beliefs about  human nature, religion and morality affect how we ask or answer the  question? How does our mortality affect our living? Classical and  contemporary writings &mdash; philosophical and autobiographical &mdash; are used.  Offered only during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 231 Philosophy of Mind </p>
              <p> Is  there anything about the human mind that cannot in principle be  understood scientifically? Are we just complex physical machines? This  course looks at recent attempts to answer such questions. Students  examine the philosophical foundations of various approaches to the  study of the mind and consider the possible moral and social  implications of these approaches with respect to questions of free  will, personal identity, and our responsibility for our actions.  Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 233 Kierkegaard and Existentialism </p>
              <p> An  introduction to Kierkegaard&rsquo;s work and to existentialism, this course  emphasizes the aesthetic, ethical, and religious &ldquo;stages on life&rsquo;s  way.&rdquo; Existential questions concerning the meaning of human existence,  pas-sion and faith, freedom and choice, despair, and the absurd are examined. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 235 Ancient Philosophy </p>
              <p> This  course surveys the origins and development of Western philosophy  starting with the pre-Socratics. Students explore the historical  foundations of natural science, metaphysics, and ethics in the works of  the pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics,  usually through primary texts. The course concludes with a brief  examination of some medieval attempts to synthesize the Greek  philosophical tra-dition  and the Judeo-Christian religious heritage. Prerequisite: one course in  philosophy or consent of instructor. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 236 History of Modern Philosophy </p>
              <p> This  course examines the development of Western philosophy in the 17th and  18th centuries. Students explore the historical foundations of central  issues in metaphysics and epistemology in the works of such thinkers as  Descartes, Pascal, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and  Kant. Topics may include conceptions of God, freedom, knowledge and  skepticism, the nature of ideas, and the foundations of modern science.  Prerequisite: one course in philosophy or consent of instructor.  Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 240 Formal Logic </p>
              <p> Formal  systems of logic attempt to make principles of good reasoning explicit.  This course introduces two such systems of logic: propositional and  predicate calculus. Students learn to use formal techniques to analyze  arguments and explore philosophical issues related to meta-theory,  including consistency and completeness, the paradoxes of material  implication, ontological commitment, and the interpretation of  quantifiers. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 241 Philosophical Theology</p>
              <p> This  course is a philosophical inquiry into the core commitments of  Christian theism in the context of other world religions and  naturalism. Central themes include beliefs about the existence and  nature of God, the doctrines of the trinity and the incarnation,  redemption and ritual, human free will and respon-sibility,  revelation and reason, religious experience, the problem of evil,  different views of life after death, miracles and historical inquiry,  and religious pluralism. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 243 Aesthetics</p>
              <p> Contemplating  art in relation to religious and moral as well as aesthetic values,  students address such issues as the nature of creation and creativity,  the character of visual metaphor, and the meaning of selected histor-ical and contemporary works of art. While developing a more informed appreciation of aesthetic proper-ties of art, students analyze major texts in philosophy of art and art criticism. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 244 Philosophy and Science</p>
              <p> Using examples from the natural sciences, this course examines fundamental concepts of science, includ-ing  scientific method, the nature of scientific theories and hypotheses,  objectivity in data collection and analysis, the use of technology in  making observations, confirmation versus falsification, and explanation  versus prediction. To illustrate why non-scientists need to understand  scientific practice the course also considers controversies such as  global warming and intelligent design. Offered most years. </p>

Where appropriate,  comparisons are drawn to Western philosophical tradi-tions. Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 252 Ethics and the Good Life </p>

              <p class="coursename"> 254 Law, Politics,and Morality </p>

Topics may include the &ldquo;Just War&rdquo;  debate, censorship, property rights and distributive justice, natural  law, political liberalism and its critics, whether governments should  act in accordance with specific moral prin-ciples or remain neutral, the tensions between individual rights and the good of the community, and the role of religion in public life.

              <p class="coursename"> 256 Friendship, Love, and the Good Life </p>
              <p> Moral issues concerning friendship and love are analyzed from the perspective of normative moral theo-ries  and various theories of value. Issues may include the role of  friendship in the moral life, exploitative versus fulfilling  relationships, and the conflict between altruism and self-love. Since  loving is itself a form of valuing, value theory is approached by  investigating philosophical and theological works concerning the basic  types of love: philia, eros, and agape. Offered most years. </p>

Offered every year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 258 Vices and Virtues</p>
              <p> This is a course in thinking morally, both about the vices and virtues and other normative moral per-spectives (e.g., Kantian, Humean, utilitarian) and about oneself. In what ways are the virtues a founda-tion  for thinking and living in daily life? What are alternative proposals  for &ldquo;the good life&rdquo; and &ldquo;right,&rdquo; by which we normally conceive human  behavior? In what ways does a Christian perspective modify our  understanding of ourselves and the virtues? Offered only during  Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 261 Freud and the Study of Human Behavior </p>
              <p> Students examine Freud&rsquo;s thesis that our thoughts and actions spring from the darkness of our uncon-scious. Because Freud based his theory on a small sample of case studies, the course scrutinizes this qual-itative  data and discusses the role of case studies in the study of human  behavior. Students evaluate the criteria for a scientific theory of  human behavior and consider whether Freud&rsquo;s theory meets them. Offered  only during Interim. </p>
