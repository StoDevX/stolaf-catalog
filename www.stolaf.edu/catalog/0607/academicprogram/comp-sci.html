              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Richard J. Allen (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), logic programming, intelligent tutoring systems; Olaf Hall-Holt (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), computational geometry, computer graphics; Charles W. Huff, Jr. (Psychology), social psychology, ethical and social issues in computing; Steven C. McKelvey (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), operations research, wildlife modeling; Matthew P. Richey (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), computational mathematics, software engineering </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Computer  science (CS) is the academic discipline that focuses on creative  computing-related problem solving and develops valuable analytical  skills in theory, abstraction, and design. St. Olaf&rsquo;s CS program  employs &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; experience to build up valuable technical skills  while reinforcing powerful computing concepts in a liberal arts  context. Beginning with the introductory  Computer Science 121, the program&rsquo;s courses draw connections with  applications in other disciplines and in areas such as multimedia  computing. The program offers an authentic  and satisfying education in the concepts and practices of computer  science; the courses below represent national expectations for an  undergraduate computer science curriculum. Undergraduate research  appears throughout the program, from foundation courses that develop  valuable project skills to advanced courses such as the Senior Capstone  Seminar. The program also incorporates a distinct liberal arts  perspective, including emphasis on teamwork and communication skills,  examination of ethical and social issues in computing, and collaboration in upper-level interdisciplinary projects. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Although CS differs from other computing areas, such as programming, information technology  (IT), and information systems (IS), the study of computer science  serves as excellent preparation for careers in such fields, because the  concepts of computer science provide insights into all forms of  computing. While specific computing systems come and go, the principles  of CS endure for the long term, and persons with awareness of those  principles perceive them in all forms of computing. The program's  emphases on development of creative problem-solving and analytical  thinking abilities, interpersonal skills, and ethical analysis and  awareness enhance any career, whether one becomes a computing  professional or an occasional user. </p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
              <p> Courses in computer science satisfy the following general education requirements: MAR, WRI, ORC and EIN. See the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedule</a> for details. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  student arranges for a computer science major by individual contract  with the computer science faculty. This provides some latitude for  choice according to individual interests and background and allows the  computer science faculty to update the curriculum easily as the field  of computer science evolves. Most contracts adhere to the guidelines  below, which derive from prominent national recommendations for  undergraduate computer science majors. </p>
              <p> Foundation courses: Either Computer Science 121, 251 and 252, or Computer Science 125; Computer Science 231; Computer Science 241. </p>
              <p> Core courses: Computer Science 253; Computer Science 263; either Computer Science 233 or 276; and </p>
              <p> either Computer Science 273 or 284. Electives and capstone: Computer Science 390 and two approved electives. These guidelines represent four levels: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> a breadth-first introduction to the discipline, through a hands-on survey of concepts (Computer Science  121 or 125) and three &ldquo;second courses&rdquo; (Computer Science 231, 241, 251)  that may be taken in any order (note that the foundation courses offer  non-majors a variety of one- to four-course samples of computer  science); </li>
                <li> core  courses in standard computer science topics, including algorithms and  data structures, ethics of computing, computer languages, and computer  systems; </li>
                <li> a deeper exposure to selected aspects of the discipline of computer science through electives; and </li>
                <li> a senior-level capstone integrative experience (Computer Science 390). </li>

Projects are  frequently interdisciplinary in nature and build on prior undergraduate  research experiences among class members. Prerequisites: Major in  computer science with senior standing, and completion of or concurrent  enrollment in computer science core courses, including Computer Science 263, or permission of instructor. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 394 Internship</p>
              <p> Students  gain experience in computer-industry positions. Projects have included  implementation of solid modeling (NURBS), agile programming practices,  documentation, business applications of computing, applications of  computer graphics in medical research, and team programming. Internship  experiences (whether for credit or not) are strongly encouraged for  anyone considering a career in computing. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 398 Independent Research </p>
              <p> Recent  projects, usually executed by individuals and coordinated with ongoing  undergraduate research projects, include extension of a networked  academic planning system, preliminary preparations for a system  for managing web-based portfolios, neural networks, random number  generation, applications of genetic algorithms to scheduling,  computational Bayesian image reconstruction, design and implementation of an interface language for linear programming software, and design of software to assist choreographers. </p>
