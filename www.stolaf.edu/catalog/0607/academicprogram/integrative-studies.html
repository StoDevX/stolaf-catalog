              <p class="programdescription"> In the Center for Integrative Studies (CIS), &ldquo;integrative studies&rdquo; refers to learning that intentionally  combines diverse methods, experiences, learning styles, subject  matters, and on- or off-campus resources. The college has a  long-standing commitment to integrative studies, evident in its many successful interdisciplinary majors and concentrations, in the 30-year history  of the St. Olaf Paracollege, and in the faculty&rsquo;s ability to combine  diverse approaches to course subjects. The CIS&rsquo;s principal activity is  to support students who plan and carry out individual, integrative  majors and help students to identify and pursue opportunities for  integrative learning on and off campus. In all these activities, the  CIS&rsquo; goal is to enhance the coherence of students&rsquo; academic careers by  encouraging them to make meaningful connections among the many parts of  their educational experience and by helping them build bridges between  the college and other communities. The CIS also offers a small  curriculum of topical seminarrs that exemplify intergrative learning. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> THE INDIVIDUAL MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  CIS is the academic home for students pursuing self-designed,  integrative majors. Students propose a sequence of courses, seminars,  independent studies, or experiential learning as the means of pursuing  an individual major. Proposals must include (1) a description of the  proposed subject matter; (2) a list of 10 or more proposed courses and  other learning experiences and an explanation of how each contributes  to the major; (3) an initial proposal for a two-semester senior  integrative project; and (4) a summary of the student&rsquo;s preparation to carry out the proposed major. Each proposal must have the support of a faculty academic adviser. The coherence, depth, and feasibility of each proposal are evaluated and approved by a faculty  review committee convened by the CIS. At the end of the senior year,  the student&rsquo;s work in the major is presented to a faculty certification  committee for review. Proposals for individual majors may be submitted  any time during the sophomore year and the first part of the junior  year. Recent individual majors include: Public Health: Policy and  Reform; Ethics and Journalism; Biostatistics: Population Modeling;  International Sustainable Development; Film Theory and Application;  Renaissance Studies; Psychology of Religious Pluralism; Western  European Architecture and Design; The Writing of Social Change; Legacies of Empire: Unity and Division in Postcolonial Societies; and Philosophy in Creative Literature. </p>
              <div>
                <h6> The Web Portfolio </h6>
                <p> Students  with individual majors create and maintain a web portfolio. A web  portfolio preserves important learning experiences and academic work.  Its web-based structure allows students to make explicit links within  their own work and to the work of other students or other sites of  public discussion. The web portfolio is presented to the faculty certification committee with the senior project at the end of the major. </p>
                <p> For  specific requirements for the individual major or for information about  other activities of the Center for Integrative Studies, please contact  the director or program coordinator. </p>

              <p class="goldsubhead"> INTEGRATIVE SEMINARS </p>
              <p> Faculty  teaching in the CIS offer integrative seminars on selected topics, open  to students in the sophomore year or later. These seminars model the  integration of tools and resources from various disciplines in new  approaches to their subjects. CIS seminars are normally repeated over  two successive years and then retired, but later may find a &ldquo;home&rdquo; in  another department or program. </p>
              <div>
                <h6> Seminars Offered in 2005-06: </h6>
                <p class="coursename"> 207 Ways of Knowing Ecology </p>
                <p> While  &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; in the strict sense refers to a specific field within  biology, the word also refers broadly to the interactions of organisms  with living and non-living components of their environments. This  seminar considers ways of knowing and thinking about this  interdependence, from scientific ways to philosophical, geographical,  and personal. Through field experiments and biography, data collection  and aesthetics, scientific analyses and history, students explore different methods of gathering and interpreting scientific information about the world. Topics include living in place, knowing a river, wind energy, and animal cloning. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 211 American Musical Theater </p>
                <p> This  seminar explores the development of a uniquely American theatrical form  from the 1850s to the present. While it cultivates understanding of the  form of musical theater itself, it also uses musical theater as a lens  through which to view developments in American culture, including the  influence of the many cultures either coming to or brought to the  United States. Students study recordings, films, and scores, as well as  popular and scholarly research into musical theater. Students see and  analyze performances, but this is not a performance course. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 212 Sport and Religion: An Inquiry into American Cultural Values </p>
                <p> Sport and religion are significant social institutions in American culture. Both command a wide following  that is passionate in its devotion. Sport has been used to promote  religion and also as a means of enhancing one&rsquo;s faith. This  relationship has evolved over time, through education, the military,  churches, and team play at different levels. But is sport actually  religious? In this seminar students investigate the connections between  sport and religion, particularly in the U.S., and consider in what ways  that relationship affects people&rsquo;s behavior. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 213 Representing and Responding to the Vietnam/American War </p>
                <p> This seminar explores responses to and representations of the war in Vietnam from a variety of perspectives. Students read literature &ndash; fiction, poetry, autobiographies, drama &ndash; by both Vietnamese and American  writers. They view and discuss depictions of the war in American films  from 1965 to the present, look at protest writing and political  journalism accompanying the war, and explore their place in American  society, and learn about the popular music that helped articulate  American responses to the war. They also examine photography and  journalism from the war, consider philosophical issues related to the  recording of suffering and violence, and explore the formal and  political choices shaping war memorials. </p>
              </div>

                <h6> Seminars Scheduled for 2006-07: </h6>
                <p class="coursename"> 202 Sport in Society </p>
                <p> Sports  are more than exercise and entertainment &ndash; they can be understood as  social phenomena, related to the social and cultural contexts in which  we live. Sports provide stories and images used to explain and evaluate  these contexts and proved a window into culture and society. This  seminar considers ways in which sports may be understood as social  constructs: Who plays sports, what happens to them, and why? Do money  and power matter in sports? If so, how? How does &ldquo;playing games&rdquo; become  formalized, institutionalized? What is the role of media in sports? Or religion? Or government?  Students discuss and produce position papers on various issues relating to sports in society. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 207 Ways of Knowing Ecology </p>
                <p> See description above. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 209 Who Owns the Arts? Sponsorship, Censorship and Artistic Freedom </p>
                <p> What  is the relationship of the arts to the rest of society? What art should  be publicly funded, and who determines this? How does corporate or  other sponsorship affect the production of art? What constitutes  censorship? How are the arts supported in different countries? This  seminar examines the intersection of ethics, money, community values,  and the arts in today's society. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 213 Representing and Responding to the Vietnam/American War </p>
                <p> See description above. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 214 The Art and Politics of the Book </p>
                <p> This seminar considers the book as cultural artifact, exploring social, political, and aesthetic issues relating to book production since the Industrial Revolution. Students study texts whose making inspired public  action or stirred controversy, including the biography and art of  alphabet books, cartography, the graphic novel, literary 'zines, fine  press books, and a selection of the following: Nick Bantock's Griffin &amp; Sabine, BWHBC's Our Bodies, Ourselves, Allen Ginsberg's Howl, Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, Audrey Niffenegger's The Three Incestuous Sisters, Robert Sabuda's America the Beautiful, and Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood.  Guest artists and field trips supplement our study. Students work  individually and collaboratively to produce artists/writers notebooks,  to research and write a book's biography, to respond to a current issue  involving books, to initiate &ldquo;pass around&rdquo; community journals, and to  produce their own books. </p>

                <p class="coursename"> 215 Film Genres </p>
                <p class="goldsubhead"> INTEGRATIVE SENIOR PROJECT </p>
                <p> Students  with individual majors register for their senior integrative projects  in each semester of the senior year. The first semester, generally used  for research and other preparation in consultation with the student's  adviser, receives a P/N evaluation; the second semester, and final  presentation of the project to the faculty certification committee,  receives a grade. A brief description of the student's major and senior  project appear on the official transcript. </p>
