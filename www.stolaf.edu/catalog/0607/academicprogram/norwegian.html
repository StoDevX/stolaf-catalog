              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/norwegian/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/norwegian/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Margaret Hayford O&rsquo;Leary, Norwegian literature and language </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Nancy Aarsvold, Norwegian language, language pedagogy, instructional technology; Torild Homstad, Norwegian literature and language; Louis Janus, Norwegian literature and language; Anne Sabo, Norwegian literature and language; Solveig Zempel, Norwegian literature and language </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Students  at St. Olaf have the opportunity to study a unique subject &mdash; Norwegian.  St. Olaf is one of a few colleges and universities where students can  use Norwegian to complete their foreign language requirement &mdash; and  beyond the requirement can study the language, literature,  culture, and history of Norway in depth. In addition to graduating with  a major in Norwegian, St. Olaf students have many opportunities to  study and travel in Norway. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of Norwegian opens the door to another culture and another way of  viewing the world. Students develop skills in communication, research,  analytical thinking, and writing  that are essential to a liberal education and are useful in a wide  range of careers. They learn about Norway&rsquo;s role in high technology,  environmental awareness, social equality, and international  peace initiatives. Some of the world&rsquo;s best literature awaits discovery  by students of Norwegian: works by authors like Ibsen, Hamsun, and  Undset, as well as by writers who have not been translated into  English. Norwegian also enables many students to explore their cultural  heritage and encourages contact with relatives and friends in Norway. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The Norwegian major allows students to gain competence in the Norwegian language and an understanding  of Norwegian society through a combination of courses in the language,  literature, history, and culture of Norway. Norwegian majors are  encouraged to use their language skills for learning in other disciplines and to experience the culture firsthand through study in Norway. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  required courses are Norwegian 111, 112, 231, 232, 253, 371, 372, a  history/cultural component (Norwegian 140, History 222, Art 266, or  other approved course), plus one additional upper level course chosen  in consultation with the chair. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Distinction in Norwegian should reflect a special interest in some aspect of Norwegian language and culture. A distinction paper or project may spring out of course work, but must go beyond and must incorporate  some public activity, whether that be print publication, website  development, oral presentation, or other public performance. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  Norwegian Department sponsors many speakers and activities such as the  annual Christmas service and Seventeenth of May breakfast and provides  students with the opportunity to live in a language house with a native  speaker assistant. The Norwegian-American Historical Association, a  rich source of information  on Norwegian immigration, is housed in R&oslash;lvaag Memorial Library. Many  students choose to study in Norway on a variety of programs. For  information on the Oslo International Summer School and the  International Studies programs in Norway, consult the Index. Norwegian  professors also participate  in the Foreign Language Across the Curriculum (FLAC) program,  collaborating with disciplinary professors to offer students the  opportunity to use their foreign language skills in selected courses in  other departments. (See the listing for <a href="flac.html">FOREIGN LANGUAGE ACROSS THE  CURRICULUM</a>.) </p>

              <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 371 Norsk Litteratur Fra Sagaene Til 1890 (Norwegian Literature from the Saga Period to 1890) </p>
              <p> A study of Norwegian literature from the Saga period through Ibsen, this chronological overview examines literary developments in the context of historical, cultural, and linguistic change and relates Norwegian literature to international trends.

              <p class="coursename"> 125 Norwegian Folklore and Folk Narrative </p>
              <p> Students study Norwegian folk narratives considered in historical and cultural contexts. Texts include traditional  fairy tales and legends from 19th century nation building, collected by  Asbj&oslash;rnsen, Moe, and others, as well as nation-keeping folklore  (riddles, jokes, and stories) in World War II-occupied Norway and  modern urban legends. Students write a fairy tale and study the  functions of folklore through classic articles, lectures, and  discussion. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 130 Nordic Film Today: Love, Sex and Familiy </p>
              <p> This  film course focuses on the increasingly non-traditional ways of forming  relationships in the Nordic countries. Rejecting the values of previous  generations, young people from different backgrounds and ethnicities  form relationships according to their own integrity and sexual  preferences. Students attain an understanding of these cultural trends  and the technical terminology to watch, read, think, talk, and write  critically and intelligently about films as text. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 140 Norway: Continuity and Change </p>
              <p> Contemporary  Norway is much more than lutefisk, lefse, Hardanger fiddles,  rosemaling, and elaborate costumes. This course examines modern  Norwegian society &ndash; imperfections and all &ndash; against the backdrop  of tradition, looking at such issues as Norway&rsquo;s role in peace  negotiations, its position as an outsider in Europe, and its evolving  relationship with the United States. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 233 Nordic Literature: Medieval to Modern </p>
              <p> Students  explore great works in Nordic literature from the medieval period  through the 20th century, including mythology, sagas, folktales, and  works by eminent writers such as Holberg, Hans Christian Andersen,  Ibsen, Strindberg, and Hamsun. The focus is on literary development in  its historical and cultural context. Readings, lectures, speaking, and written assignments are in English. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 294 Internship</p>
              <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 382 Ibsen</p>
              <p> Students  analyze the plays of Henrik Ibsen in English translation using a  variety of critical approaches. Students investigate ethical issues and  themes in Ibsen&rsquo;s plays by examining the plays through the lens of  ethics, using readings in ethical theory to better understand both the  ethical issues and the plays themselves.  Students also study Ibsen&rsquo;s dramatic technique and the historical and  literary context of his work. Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 394 Internship </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 398 Independent Research</p>
