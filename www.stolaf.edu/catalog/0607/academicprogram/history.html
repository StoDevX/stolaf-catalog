              <p> <span class="programdescription">History  explores the many facets of the human condition from the past to the  present. History invites those who study it to develop an appreciation  for the variety of human experiences. Demonstrating how the past shapes  the present, the study of history also encourages an understanding  of different world cultures, societies, and outlooks in their own  terms. Students learn to analyze and to think critically about a broad  range of issues and experiences. They also learn how to develop  reasoned arguments and explanations from historical evidence. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Among  St. Olaf departments, the History Department is distinctive in the  variety of courses it offers for the college&rsquo;s interdisciplinary  programs. These courses are described here; and they are also listed in  such program descriptions as American studies, Asian studies, environmental  studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. In addition, history courses fulfill  several different general education requirements, according to subject  matter. The department is a major provider of HWC, MCS-G, MCS-D, and  WRI courses. Some history courses count toward ALS-L and HBS. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of history provides students with liberal arts preparation for a  wide range of professional and personal vocations. Most history majors  pursue careers in such fields as business, education, law, and government service. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> St. Olaf&rsquo;s history offerings are structured to help students achieve different learning goals at different levels. In Level I seminars, students approach history as a way of learning, through the critical reading of primary sources on specific historical topics. In Level I foundational surveys, they explore the broad historical  development of the world&rsquo;s major societies and cultures. In most Level  II courses, students examine more specialized national, area, and  topical developments. In Level II major seminars, students develop  their skills of analysis, interpretation, argumentation, and  expression. Finally, Level III seminars challenge students to recognize  historical problems and to formulate their own questions about major  historical issues, entering the ongoing debates of historians. </p>
              <p> History courses at Level I do not have prerequisites. Level I seminars are only open to first-year students;  Level I foundational surveys are open to everybody. History courses at  Level II generally do not have prerequisites either, since many of them  count for general education credit. The major seminars at Level II are  especially designed for history majors, although other students may  enroll as space permits. Level III courses generally require  significant prior preparation; students with little or no background in  a particular area or period should consult with the instructor before  registration. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> History  majors are required to take nine courses, including one Level II major  seminar and three courses at Level III. Three Level I courses (but no  more than two seminars) may count toward the major. Students must take  at least one course in each of three general areas, i.e., Europe,  United States, and the non-Western  world (Africa, Asia, Latin America). This area requirement should be  fulfilled in Level I or Level II courses. At least two courses in the  major must deal with the pre-modern period; see the departmental  website or the History Department chair for the approved list of  pre-modern courses. Other courses may meet this requirement if approved  by the department chair. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Senior  majors who seek a significant intellectual experience and who  demonstrate high achievement in historical research and writing may  apply for departmental distinction. Candidates must satisfy minimum  grade point average requirements (3.30 overall, 3.50 in the major),  prepare a paper under the direction of an adviser in the department and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  to the chair of the Distinction Committee by Nov. 15 of their senior  year. The formal review begins in mid-March. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The History Department supports several other programs: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> The  social studies education major (see SOCIAL STUDIES EDUCATION) with a  primary core in history is appropriate for those considering a career  in high school teaching. In addition to the general  requirements for the social studies education major (see EDUCATION  catalog description and faculty), students in this major are required  to complete a primary core that includes History 191 and another course  in European history; History 198 and 199; and History 195 or a course  in Asian, African, or Latin American history. </li>
                <li> The  interdisciplinary historical perspectives concentration enables  students to create a coherent group of five courses (from within and  without the History Department) about a particular era, theme, or  region of the world. See HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES for additional  information. </li>
                <li> The Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) program offers students opportunities to integrate  their foreign-language skills with the study of history. Students in  specially designated history classes can use their Greek, Latin,  Spanish, French, German, Russian, or Chinese so that nothing is lost to  them in translation! </li>
                <li> History courses taken in St. Olaf off-campus programs can often be counted toward the major. Students who wish to count off-campus courses toward the major should seek approval from the department chair before beginning their programs. Some restrictions apply. </li>
                <li> Historical internships with academic content may also be accepted for major credit. </li>
              </ol>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> LEVEL I: HISTORY SEMINARS </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Courses  numbered 101-189 are seminars open only to first-year college students.  Each focuses on a different topic, but all explore the fundamental  problems of history, emphasizing analysis of primary sources and  critical assessment of historical interpretations. Seminars are offered  each semester and during the Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 101 Ancient Warfare </p>
              <p> This seminar examines the social and political role of warfare in ancient Greek and Roman history. Students  investigate the concepts of war and peace by considering the role of  the soldier within society, details of tactics and logistics, and the  impact of warfare on both combatants and non-combatants alike. The  seminar uses primary sources to examine these themes. Offered  periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 111 Viking and Medieval Scandinavia </p>
              <p> A  survey of Nordic history from the time of the Viking expansion to the  period of the Kalmar Union. Topics include Viking expansion and  conquest; Nordic cultural and religious life; the coming of Christianity; the sagas and other literary sources; later medieval developments. Offered most years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 115 Courtly Love in the Middle Ages </p>
              <p> The  idea of courtly love typically evokes images of brave knights and fair  ladies vowing eternal devotion in elegant language. How such a concept  took hold in the early 12th century, and what the consequences have  been for people of that time to the present, is the subject of our  inquiry. This course explores the ideal of courtly love, its social  function, its role in literature, the arts, and music, its ambiguous  relationship to Christianity  and to the feudal system, and finally, its critics, through  interpretive reading of texts from the period supplemented by  background lectures and readings from secondary sources. Offered most  years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 121 The Making of Modern Russia </p>
              <p> This  course explores the origins of the modern Russian empire. Using primary  sources including chronicles, folktales, legal codes, letters, and  religious icons, students consider Russia&rsquo;s development from a loose  collection  of princedoms into a powerful, multi-ethnic empire spanning 11 time  zones. Topics include the impact of geography and climate, the Orthodox  religion, Mongol rule, gender roles, the rise of autocracy, and social  rebellion. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 122 Europe and the Great War </p>
              <p> Focusing  on social and cultural history, students use literature, film, and  propaganda to examine total war and its impact on gender, state, and  society. How did the 19th century prepare Europeans for war? How did  different experiences in the trenches and on the home front contribute  to gender anxieties? Was the war an agent of progress or midwife to the  brutality of the 20th century? Offered most years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 125 The Maya: Colonial Times to the Present </p>
              <p> This  course examines the history of the Maya peoples from the colonial to  the present. Drawing upon missionary accounts, archeological sources,  and historical and anthropological works, students explore how the Maya  &ndash; despite the multiple traumas of conquest, demographic collapse, and  state repression &ndash; have managed to survive as a people. Specific topics  include: Maya religious beliefs, the impact of Spanish conquest, changing sources of ethnic identity, and the emerging Pan-Maya movement of recent years. Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 135 Vietnam</p>
              <p> This seminar places the American experience in Vietnam in the Vietnamese historical context. By examining  and interpreting primary sources, students examine the heritage of  Vietnamese culture and society, French colonial rule, nationalism and  the struggle for independence, Communism and the Cold War, the causes  and consequences of the American role in Vietnam, and the effect of the  war on Laos and Cambodia. Emphasis on interpreting primary sources. Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 150 Life History of African Women</p>
              <p> This  course offers an introduction to personal narrative as a form of  historical expression. Reading includes several published life  histories of African women, along with examples of African women&rsquo;s auto-biography.  Students learn about the lives of African women through their own  stories, and they examine the process through which these stories are  made available to us. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 161 Race and Culture in Early North America </p>
              <p> This  seminar examines the interaction of Native Americans, Africans, and  Europeans in early America from first encounters through the Seven  Years War (1500-1763). Topics include race war and Native American  resistance, the origins of American slavery, the transformation of  European culture, and the development of colonial societies. Students  work with primary documents and secondary sources that demonstrate a  variety of methods and approaches. Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 162 American Revolution</p>
              <p> This  course focuses upon the American Revolution as a crucible of cultural  change. Students work with primary documents and secondary sources that  address significant topics: social change in 18th-century North  America; the politics of resistance and revolution; war and American  culture; the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; the emergence of  American democracy; and &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; such as loyalists, Native Americans, women, and African-Americans. Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 165 Slavery in the Americas </p>
              <p> This  seminar, using only eyewitness accounts, examines African slavery in  the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Typical readings  include the narrative of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs&rsquo;  autobiography, and the writings of slave-holders like Mary Chesnut.  Topics include the slave trade, the origins of African-American  culture, women and slavery, and the origins of the Civil War. The  course concludes with an examination of the process of emancipation.  Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 167 Trail of Tears </p>
              <p> This  course examines the origin and lasting effects of the Indian Removals  of the 1830s. Topics covered include the culture and history of the  Native peoples of the Eastern woodlands, U.S.-Indian policy, frontier  life in the early U.S. Republic, and the life and personal involvement  of Andrew Jackson. Students read from a wide variety of secondary  literature and primary source material, and have the opportunity to  conduct their own research. Offered periodically. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 168 R&Oslash;lvaag&rsquo;s America </p>
              <p> On the basis of selected works of O.E.
