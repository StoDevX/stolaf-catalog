              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Anne H. Groton, Greek and Roman drama, classical languages and literature </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Christopher M. Brunelle, Latin poetry, classical languages and literature; Mark T. Gustafson, Roman studies, classical languages and literature; James M. May, Greek and Roman rhetoric, classical languages and literature; Steve Reece, Greek and Roman epic, classical languages and literature</span> </p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Long  ago the Greeks and Romans conceived the idea of the liberal arts and  made them the basis of higher education. Today the Department of  Classics keeps that classical tradition alive at St. Olaf by offering  courses in the languages, literature, and culture of ancient Greece and  Rome. Studying antiquity gives students perspective on their own place  in history; it increases their understanding of the past, of the world  in which Christianity was born. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Many  students satisfy the foreign language requirement with three semesters  of Greek or Latin. Greek is especially helpful for pre-seminary and  pre-medicine students, Latin for pre-law students. Either language makes a good match with the Great Conversation program. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Every term the Department of Classics offers at least one course that demands no knowledge  of Greek or Latin and fulfills general education requirements; among  the most popular of these classics courses are Greek and Roman Myth  (Classics 241) and the annual Interim in Greece (Classics 251). </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students often combine a major in Greek or Latin with another major. A classical background  enriches one&rsquo;s experiences in college and in later life, while the  verbal and analytical skills acquired by learning classical languages  are of lasting benefit in whatever career one chooses. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJORS </h5>
              <p> Three  different majors in classical language are available to St. Olaf  students: Greek, Latin, and classics. The classics major combines Greek  and Latin and is the most rigorous. All three majors have as their  objectives understanding of classical language at an advanced level,  skill in translating and analyzing classical literature of different genres, and basic knowledge about classical civilization. Potential Latin teachers  may complete a Latin education major. Ancient studies and medieval  studies, two interdisciplinary majors overseen by the Department of  Classics, are described elsewhere in this catalog. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </h5>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> To  attain distinction in classics, a student must demonstrate talent with  classical languages and literature, skill in conducting research on a  classical topic and broad knowledge of classical civilization. Specific  guidelines are available from the Classics Department. Classics majors  who wish to pursue distinction should notify the department chair no  later than January 1 of their senior year. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> For  more than 25 years St. Olaf students have had the opportunity to spend  the month of January in Greece while enrolled in Classics 251  (Classical Studies in Greece), an Interim course focusing on ancient  Greek art and history. St. Olaf offers a Latin major with teaching  license for students preparing to teach Latin in K-12 schools. Students  pursuing a full K-6, K-12, 5-12, or 9-12 license in another content  area may earn a K-8 specialty in Latin teaching with an endorsement to  their other license. Education 349 is a teaching methods course  designed specifically for future Latin instructors. Students may put  their Greek or Latin courses to use as the core of an interdisciplinary  major in ancient studies or medieval studies. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> GREEK COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 111, 112 Beginning Greek I, II </p>
              <p> In this two-course sequence students learn the basics of ancient Greek. By studying the language&rsquo;s vocabulary,  grammar, and syntax, they not only gain appreciation for its  intricacies and nuances but also learn more about their own language  and about language in general. Completion of both semesters equips students  to translate almost any ancient Greek text with the aid of a  dictionary. Prerequisite for Greek 112: Greek 111 or equivalent.  Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 231 Intermediate Greek </p>
              <p> Third-semester Greek students read selections from Plato&rsquo;s dialogues (Apology, Crito, Phaedo) in  uncut, original versions, reviewing basic vocabulary, grammar, and  syntax while translating the Greek texts. The class discusses the life  and death of Socrates and the significance of the dialogues as works of  literature. Prerequisite: Greek 112 or equivalent. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 253 New Testament Greek </p>
              <p> The  New Testament is the most famous and most widely translated Greek text  from antiquity. Students delight in reading one or more of the Gospels,  the Acts of the Apostles, or selected Pauline letters in the original  language. Questions about the transmission of the text and about its  theological implications provoke lively discussions. Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study</p>
              <p class="coursename"> 370 Topics in Greek Literature</p>
              <p> Students translate selections from one or more genres of ancient Greek literature while exploring a specific  topic or theme chosen by the instructor. Close study of the text is  combined with discussion of broader literary, historical, and cultural  questions. Sample topics: &ldquo;Famous Speeches in Ancient Greek Texts,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Praise and Blame in the Greek Poetic Tradition,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tall Tales from  Homer to Lucian.&rdquo; Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered every third year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 372 Greek Philosophers</p>
              <p> It  has been said that all philosophy is a mere footnote to Plato and  Aristotle. In this Greek course students read extensively in the works  of the two renowned philosophers while examining the forces that influenced  them and the impact that Greek philosophy exerted on subsequent ages.  Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 373 Greek Historians</p>
              <p> Readings from the works of Herodotus, the &ldquo;Father of History,&rdquo; and Thucydides, the first &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; historian,  provide the backdrop for studying the development of Greek  historiography. Students analyze the historians&rsquo; distinctive methods  and writing styles and compare them with those of modern historians. Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 374 Greek Drama</p>
              <p> Like  the genre that it describes, the word &ldquo;drama&rdquo; is itself of Greek  origin. From the treasure-trove left to us by Aeschylus, Sophocles,  Euripides, Aristophanes, and Menander, students translate one or two complete plays and discuss the evolution of the Greek theater, staging, and modern interpretations. Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 375 Homer and Greek Epic </p>
              <p> The primary texts for this course are Homer&rsquo;s Iliad and Odyssey, the  earliest recorded literature of Western civilization. Besides  translating lengthy passages from one or both of these remarkable  poems, students probe the characteristics of epic poetry and  investigate current topics in Homeric scholarship. Prerequisite: Greek 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 398 Independent Research</p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> LATIN COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 111, 112 Beginning Latin I, II </p>
              <p> In this two-course sequence students learn the basics of classical Latin. By studying the language&rsquo;s vocabulary,  grammar, and syntax, they not only gain appreciation for its  intricacies and nuances but also learn more about their own language  and about language in general. Completion of both semesters equips students  to translate almost any classical Latin text with the aid of a  dictionary. Prerequisite for Latin 112: Latin 111 or equivalent.  Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 231 Intermediate Latin </p>
              <p> Third-semester Latin students have the opportunity to read large portions of two orations (First Catilinarian, Pro Caelio) by  Cicero and selections from Catullus&rsquo; poetry, in uncut, original  versions, while reviewing vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. Besides  translating the Latin texts, the class discusses late Republican Rome  and the stylistic features of the literature. Prerequisite: Latin 112  or equivalent. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 235 Medieval Latin </p>
              <p> Latin  was spoken in one form or another for more than two thousand years.  This course focuses on authors and texts dating roughly from 300 to  1500 A.D. and emphasizes the role of Latin as the language of the  Church and of the intelligentsia during the Middle Ages. Prerequisite:  Latin 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 252 Vergil and Latin Epic</p>
              <p> Lord Tennyson called Vergil the &ldquo;wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.&rdquo; Students encounter that stately measure when they translate selections from Vergil&rsquo;s three major poems (Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid). They  also engage in spirited discussion of Homer&rsquo;s influence on Vergil and  of Vergil&rsquo;s influence on the literature, art, and music of Western  civilization. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent. Offered in alternate years. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 370 Topics in Latin Literature </p>
