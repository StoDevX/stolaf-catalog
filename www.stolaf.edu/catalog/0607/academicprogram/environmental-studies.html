              <p> <span class="programdescription">Environmental  studies combines the strengths of disciplinary work in the contributing  departments together with interdisciplinary studies, giving both broad  and focused perspectives  on environmental problems and issues. The program offers a major in  environmental studies with three tracks or options in which students  may choose to focus their work: natural sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities. In many cases, work in these tracks overlaps  with traditional departmental curricula, and students may choose to  complete a second major there. Recognizing the global dimensions of  many environmental problems and the need for learning outside of the  classroom, the program provides a number of opportunities for studies  abroad and in the field. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> All  students majoring in environmental studies take four courses from a  common set of core offerings which emphasize the interdisciplinary  nature of environmental problems and issues. Students then choose one  of the three tracks in which to focus their work. Courses required from  two cognate groups outside of the selected track provide essential  knowledge, methods, and perspectives to complement the focus. All  majors complete an experiential component during their studies and take a capstone course for a total of 12 required courses. Students  wishing to count courses not specifically designated as satisfying  requirements for the major may petition the Environmental Studies  Advisory Board prior to enrollment. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  program also offers a concentration in environmental studies for  students wishing to complement a disciplinary major with a smaller core  of courses and electives focused on the environment. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
              <p> Because of their interdisciplinary character, environmental studies courses are most appropriate for students  seeking to fulfill general education requirements. The introductory  seminar, Environmental Studies 137, serves many students in the NST  (non-lab) area, and other environmental studies courses generally  fulfill one or more of the general education requirements. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>

This may be one of the off-campus  environmental studies courses/programs, or an internship, or a research  project approved by the director. Guidelines and a set of approved  courses are available from the director and are posted on the program  website. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> TRACKS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES MAJOR </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> Natural Science </h6>
                <p> The  natural science track seeks to give students a broad exposure to the  range of problems encountered by scientists working in environmental  fields and the investigative tools they use, while providing a solid  foundation for further study in one of the contributing disciplines.  Students planning careers in environmental  science are strongly urged to consider an additional major in biology  or chemistry. Eight courses are required in addition to the four  specified above: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Mathematics 212 or Mathematics 272 </li>
                  <li> Foundation Courses (two courses: one biology, one chemistry): Biology 261 or Biology 226; Chemistry 247/253 </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Disciplinary Courses (three courses: two from group A, or two from group B, and one from group C): </li>
                    <li> A. Biology 242; Biology 248; Biology 252; Biology 263; Biology 371 B. Chemistry 255/256; Chemistry 391 (environmental themes); Chemistry 379 C. Environmental Studies 245; Environmental Studies 255 </li>

                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6> Social Science </h6>
                <p> The  social science track is a contract major in which students select a set  of disciplinary and cognate courses in consultation with an advisor. In  addition to the core courses and the capstone seminar (specified above), students will select seven additional courses from the following groups: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> One course in statistics or mathematical modeling </li>
                  <li> Social  Science Courses (two courses from the following list, in addition to  the social science course taken for the core requirement): Economics  242; Environmental Studies 225; Environmental Studies 232;  Environmental Studies 201; Political Science 276; Political Science 221  (Australia); Sociology/Anthropology 222 (Australia); Sociology/Anthropology 249 </li>
                  <li> Contract: Students will complete the major with an individualized contract tailored to their particular interests. The contract will consist of five courses that include substantive analysis of the environment  and represent a coherent theme. Three of the courses may be those  counted in the social science group above and the social science core.  When courses do not explicitly focus on the environment, students must  arrange with the instructor to write papers and other assignments with  environmental themes. Examples of possible contracts include:  environmental law, U.S. environmental policy, international environmental policy, the economy and the environment, environmental education, culture and the environment. </li>
                  <li> Cognate Courses (at least two courses: one from the natural sciences cognate group and one from the arts and humanities group) </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6> Arts and the Humanities </h6>
                <p> The arts and humanities track requires seven courses in addition to the core courses and the capstone seminar (specified above). In addition, four of the courses must be Level II or above. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Arts and Humanities Courses (five courses from the following list, in addition to the arts and humanities course taken for the core requirement): </li>
                    <li> Environmental Studies 101-109; Environmental Studies 222; Environmental Studies 259; Environmental Studies 270; English 257 (environmental themes); English 276; History 275; Philosophy 257 </li>
                    <li> Cognate Courses (at least two courses: one from the Natural Sciences cognate group and one from the Social Science group) </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p> The  environmental studies concentration draws upon the disciplinary  strengths of a traditional major and a set of core courses focused on  the environment. Students may utilize environmental studies-related  upper-level courses within their own discipline to complete  requirements of the concentration. </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Core Courses: Students  electing the environmental studies concentration will complete the four  core courses required for environmental studies majors described above. </li>
                <li> Electives: Students  will choose two additional environmental studies courses from among  those listed in the core, cognate, or disciplinary groups above or from  the list of courses in other departments (below). This may include (but  need not) the senior seminar. Elective courses have a significant component  that addresses environmental concerns, but they need not have  environmental issues as their exclusive focus. For some electives,  students may be required to negotiate specific assignments with the  instructor and the Environmental Studies Advisory Committee to receive  credit toward the concentration. </li>
                <li> Experiential Component: All students concentrating in environmental studies will participate  in an experience which applies basic knowledge in a setting beyond the  classroom. This may be one of the many off-campus environmental studies  courses listed in the catalog or an internship or research project approved by the director. Criteria are listed on the environmental studies website. </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> A number of off-campus programs include an internship or independent study component in which stu-dents  may elect to focus on environmental issues. Students must consult with  the environmental studies director in planning their programs and must  receive approval before counting work from off-campus programs toward  an environmental studies concentration. The programs listed below have  a substantial focus in environmental studies and will generally satisfy  environmental studies requirements: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Biology in South India </li>
                <li> Environmental Studies in Australia </li>
                <li> Superior Studies </li>
                <li> Tropical Field Research (ACM) </li>
                <li> Washington Semester in International Environment and Development (American University) </li>

              <p class="coursename"> 101 The Culture of Nature </p>
              <p> This American environmental history explores the social construction of nature in the 20th century, looking  at the roots (both natural and cultural) of contemporary environmental  issues. To figure out what nature means to us now, students study the  history of stuff, the culture of grasslands and lawns, the changing  character of the city and the country, the nature of the suburbs, the  conservation and preservation movements, different energy ecologies,  the nature of TV, the contemporary environmental movement, and  alternative ecological practices. They also use the St. Olaf campus as  a case study of 20th-century environmental design. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 125 Conservation Biology </p>
              <p> Conservation  biology focuses on the study of biological diversity. Students examine  why we should be concerned about the number and types of species on  earth, what factors threaten the survival of species and how we can  conserve them. Using principles of ecology and evolution, with input  from other disciplines,  students gain a better understanding of the impact of humans on  biodiversity and the importance of responsible environmental  decision-making. Counts toward major and concentration: environmental  studies. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 137 Introduction to Environmental Studies </p>
              <p> This interdisciplinary seminar uses basic concepts of environmental science to explore global environmental issues. Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and participants will recognize  many of the seminar issues from coverage in the media. Because most  environmental problems involve issues beyond the science, the seminar  examines the economic, political and ethical dimensions of  environmental questions and environmental decision-making. Offered  every semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 201 Topics in Global Environmental Politics </p>
              <p> Population growth, industrialization, and the consumption of fossil fuels have increased global environmental  problems. The course examines the ways in which nation-states and/or  international institutions have addressed these environmental concerns.  Depending on the instructor, the focus of the course is either the  environmental problems of a particular area (e.g., Latin America,  Russia, or Asia) or a broader global arena (e.g., international  institutions and the environment). Counts toward major and concentration: environmental studies. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 222 Campus Ecology </p>
              <p> This  course explores key concepts of ecology, focusing explicitly on the  ideal of ecological sustainability for the St. Olaf College campus.  Students attend both to contemporary environmental issues and to the  ideas and institutions that shape human resource use. Working groups  research topics such as curriculum, clothes, cars, water, waste, food,  energy, procurement, and landscape in the context of American religious  and environmental values. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 225 Environmental Political Theory </p>
              <p> This course examines relations between conceptions of &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and political issues of power, justice, liberty,  and equality; and it explores theoretical foundations from which  ecologically grounded institutions, policies, and political  understandings airse. The course attends to issues currently being  addressed by international green political theorists, including  &ldquo;ecological citizenship&rdquo; and &ldquo;green democracy.&rdquo; </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 232 Environmental Policy and Regulation </p>
              <p> This  course analyzes environmental regulation in the United States with  respect to its historical evolution, its ability to achieve  environmental targets, its efficiency or cost-effectiveness, its  distributional impact on jobs, people, and industries across the  country, and its international ramifications. Class meetings include  open discussions with individuals from agencies charged with developing  and enforcing environmental regulation. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 245 Global Climate Change </p>
              <p> This  course is an interdisciplinary seminar on climate throughout the  earth&rsquo;s history, including recent changes caused by humankind. It  examines the climate system in the larger framework of planetary evolution and explores evidence from the geologic record for climates of the past. Using current scientific literature,  students investigate causes of climate change and consider scenarios  for future climate based on models incorporating alternative global  development strategies. Offered annually. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 255 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems </p>
              <p> Remote sensing and GIS are increasingly used to address basic and applied questions in the environmental  sciences and a host of other disciplines. Students survey available  remote sensing image types and learn to process (ground-truthing, GPS,  scanning, digitizing) and interpret remotely sensed images. They also  learn theory and practice of geographic information systems (basic  cartography and spatial statistics). A weekly 3-hour laboratory is  required. Counts toward major and concentration in environmental  studies. Prerequisite: Environmental Studies 137 or a Level 1 course in  biology, chemistry or physics. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 259 Saving Wild Places </p>
              <p> The discussion of wilderness today often focuses on non-human benefits, such as the protection of biodiversity  or wildlife habitat. A significant tradition of American thought and  literature also emphasizes the benefits of wilderness for human beings,  including spirituality, freedom, morality, self-reliance, and solitude.  This seminar, offered annually, explores the importance of wilderness  in American thought and assesses its value for society today. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 270 Nature and American Landscapes </p>
              <p> This seminar-style course develops students&rsquo; abilities to reflect on Americans&rsquo; encounters with their landscape traditions. Students study ways Americans have built on the land and have worshipped and represented nature in paintings, photographs, and advertisements. Students learn to read landscapes, to discover  how important artistically, religiously, and ecologically the landscape  tradition has been in the Unites States, and to become thoughtful  viewers and creators of landscapes. Counts toward major: art, art  history and environmental studies. Counts toward concentration:  American studies, environmental studies. </p>
