              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/theatre/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/theatre/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Brian Bjorklund, design and technical theater </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Dona Freeman, acting; Gary Gisselman, acting, directing; William Sonnega, theater, media studies; Karen Peterson Wilson, theater, voice/phonetics, oral interpretation </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  St. Olaf Department of Theatre takes for its subject matter all aspects  of making theater. It produces a season of plays whose focus is the  liberal arts curriculum rather than a typical theater company&rsquo;s season  of plays. All classes focus on the making of dramatic art. Classes in  history and theory, no less than those in acting, directing, and  design, approach the problems and difficulties of making production  their central issue. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  activities and skills necessary for learning about and making theater  are well suited to learning about and contributing to lives of worth  and service. The basic theater activity is making things: play scripts,  sets, costumes, characters, and the complete works of which these are a  part. The theater skills are leading, following, reading, writing,  talking, drawing, building, acting, performing, and making  arrangements. We place these skills in the service of our conception of  theater as a way of knowing. Our courses, along with the rest of the college  curriculum, develop an appreciation of the need for moral choice, an  imagination that constructs and examines alternatives, and an  understanding of creativity as a reality in the world and an agency of  community and change. We think of the program as a kind of laboratory for a serious and productive life. This is what we mean when we call the study of theater at St. Olaf a liberal arts major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In  contemporary culture, theater and the entertainment industry overlap,  with the result that public approbation and artistic success have  become difficult to separate. Our program emphasizes process as well as  public performance so that students can, without the confusing  interference of popular acclaim or criticism, learn to judge their own  work according to principles  derived from the art itself. And as part of the fine arts at St. Olaf,  we also emphasize collaboration and the interdisciplinary nature of  theater. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The St. Olaf College Theatre Department is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre. </p>

              <p> St. Olaf is requesting approval from the Minnesota Board of  Teaching to offer a K-12 teaching license in theater. This would be effective for the class of 2007. Board approval is pending. Contact Mark Schelske, Education Department chair, for further information. </p>
