              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>French Section Head, 2006-07:</strong> M. Clare Mather (Romance Languages), Francophone theater, Qu&eacute;bec studies </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Wendy Allen (Romance Languages), 17th-century French literature, contemporary France, the Maghreb, content-based instruction; Jolene Barjasteh (Romance Languages), 19th-century French literature, autobiography; Mary Cisar (Romance Languages), 18th-century French literature, feminist criticism, Franco-Manitoban studies; Scott Homler (Romance Languages), 20th-century French literature, Francophone literature, culture, and civilization; Herv&eacute; Pensec (Romance  Languages), medieval and 16th-century French literature, classical  theater, Francophone Caribbean literature and culture </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">French  holds an important position among the world&rsquo;s languages. More than 200  million people around the world &mdash; in North and South America, the  Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Pacific and Indian  Oceans, and Indochina &mdash; speak French. French remains, with English, one  of the two languages into which all United Nations documents must be  translated.  Thus, students considering careers in business, diplomacy, the church,  or teaching are well advised to complete a major in French, sometimes  along with another major. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> By studying French and other Francophone cultures, civilizations, and literatures, students develop and enhance oral and written language skills, analytical thinking, and familiarity with diverse philosophies and perspectives, all of which are central to liberal arts education with a global perspective. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  French section of the Department of Romance Languages offers a variety  of courses, on campus and abroad, in French language, Francophone  cultures/civilizations, and literatures for beginning, intermediate, and advanced students, both majors and non-majors. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> To  expand students&rsquo; exposure to French beyond the classroom, the French  program hosts a weekly French conversation table and film series and  sponsors an honor house (Maison fran&ccedil;aise). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE FRENCH MAJOR </h5>
              <p> In courses for the major, students gain understanding of Francophone literatures, civilizations, and contemporary cultures as they develop analytical and communication skills in the language. </p>
              <p> 200-level  courses are divided into two sequences. In 250-level courses, students  practice and refine their emerging language skills through textual  analysis, writing, and discussion. In 270-level courses, students explore the diverse cultures and literatures of the Francophone world. </p>
              <p> 300-level  courses build upon the interpretive skills and knowledge of the  Francophone world acquired by students in 270-level courses. 300-level  courses examine a particular topic or genre as well as critical or  theoretical issues associated with it through the analysis of  representative works. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </h5>
              <p> All  French majors are urged to study in France or in another Francophone  country. This is particularly important for French teaching majors. </p>
              <p> Students  who participate in an approved semester-long St. Olaf study abroad  program normally receive credit for one French course toward the major  and one credit for the required French/Francophone history course. Students who participate in an approved year-long St. Olaf study abroad program normally receive credit for two French courses toward the major and one credit for the required French/Francophone history course. </p>
            </div>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR A GRADUATION MAJOR: </h5>
