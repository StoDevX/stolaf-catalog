              <p> <span class="programdescription">The Department of Economics seeks to create a teaching and learning community that provides  students with varied opportunities for acquiring the necessary  knowledge, analytical skills, and judgment to prepare them for personal  and professional growth and for confident and responsible leadership in  a rapidly changing world. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  department encourages students: (1) to learn about the economic,  commercial and governmental institutions that serve the American and  international communities, (2) to be competent in economic and  statistical analysis, and (3) to be cognizant of historical, global and moral perspectives on economic and business issues. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMICS PROGRAM </h5>
              <p> Economics  is the study of how people and organizations make decisions, how they  interact with each other, and how institutions and policies can be  designed to improve people&rsquo;s lives. The ambition of those who study  economics is to understand the world around them both as it is and as  it ought to be. The basic principles of economics are applied to a wide  range of social and political challenges that confront us today. These  include international trade, environmental protection, health care,  development, domestic taxes, Federal Reserve policies, labor  outsourcing, and the regulation of private business. </p>
              <p> The economics curriculum at St. Olaf includes theory, applications, institutional studies, and quantitative analysis. Where appropriate, economics courses also pursue historical and ethical concerns. </p>
              <p> The department offers areas of emphasis for its majors who desire more focused study in finance, management, international economics, and policy analysis. The department also supports several programs available  to students regardless of major: an interdisciplinary concentration in  management studies, the programs of the Finstad Office for  Entrepreneurial Studies, study abroad, and internship opportunities. </p>
              <p> The  economics major serves as excellent preparation for careers in a wide  variety of fields, including economic analysis, banking, accounting,  consulting, health administration, finance, business management,  teaching, and international affairs. The major also provides a solid  foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in  economics, business, public policy, and law. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p>Majors in economics must meet the  following minimum requirements: two courses in mathematics, (1) Mathematics 120  or its equivalent, and (2) <em>either</em> a course offered in the Mathematics  Department that has Mathematics 120 as a prerequisite <em>or </em>Economics 233; &nbsp;Economics 261 and 262; Statistics 263, or  Statistics 272 plus Economics 385; and at least four courses in economic  analysis. Economics 261 and 262, and Statistics 263, or Statistics 272 plus  Economics 385, cannot be taken S/U. The economics major requires four courses  in economic analysis with a minimum of one at Level II and two at Level III  unless the student completes an Area of Emphasis. Majors who also complete an  Area of Emphasis within the department must complete three additional courses  in economic analysis, at least one of which must be at Level III. </p>
              <p> In the course of their studies, economics majors should also gain working knowledge of a statistical computing package, a text processor, and an electronic spreadsheet. </p>
              <p> Students  considering graduate work in economics are advised to take additional  courses in economic analysis (including Economics 385) and mathematics  (Mathematics 126 or 128, 220, 226 or 228, and 244). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Information about the criteria considered in conferring distinction is available on the department web page. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> Areas of Emphasis </h6>
                <p> Areas  of emphasis provide the opportunity for economics majors to pursue a  more structured program of study beyond the normal major requirements.  The department offers two management studies areas of emphasis and two  economics areas of emphasis. Contracts for each area of emphasis must  be individually negotiated with the appropriate director before the end  of the student&rsquo;s junior year. Students may be certified in one management studies and one economics area of emphasis. </p>
                <p> Management studies areas of emphasis include finance and management. Each requires five management  studies courses including a Level III Management Studies course that  also satisfies one of the requirements for the economics major. A grade  of C or better must be earned in each of the five courses. </p>
                <p> The finance area of emphasis requires  Management Studies 225, either Management Studies 237 or 259,  Management Studies 281, plus two approved electives, at least one at  Level III. The management area of emphasis requires  Management Studies 225, Management Studies 237, Management Studies 251,  plus two approved electives, at least one at Level III. </p>
                <p> The international economic analysis and policy area of emphasis requires Economics 382 (International  Economics), two Level II international-related courses from Economics  218, 238 and 243, and one elective outside the department that has an  international emphasis, such as a course taken abroad. </p>
                <p> The public policy area of emphasis includes  Economics 371 (Economics of Public Policy) and two economics analysis  courses chosen from the following list: Economics 242, 244, 245, 249  and 385. </p>
                <p> A  grade of C or above is required for all courses in the area of  emphasis. The Level III course for either area of emphasis may also be  counted toward the economics major. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> CONCENTRATIONS AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  Economics Department participates in international studies programs and  encourages its majors to take advantage of study in other countries.  The department also participates in several interdisciplinary majors  and concentrations, including American studies, Asian studies,  management studies, Hispanic studies, statistics, environmental  studies, women&rsquo;s studies, and the social studies education major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> INTRODUCTORY COURSES </p>
              <p> Courses  numbered 110-120 all present a common core of economic principles, and  therefore credit will be given for only one of these courses. Courses  numbered 110-120 cannot be taken after taking Economics 121 or 122.  Students may only take one course from among 110-120; none of these  courses may be repeated. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 110-120 Gateways to Economics</p>
              <p> These  classes introduce first-year students to principles of economics  through special topics. Each course emphasizes the application of  economic concepts to topics of general interest, capitalizing on the  special interests and expertise of the faculty. A list of topics and  course descriptions will be included with registration materials each semester. These courses are open only to first-year students. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 112 Economies in Transition</p>
              <p> At one time, roughly one-third of the world&rsquo;s population lived in countries with centrally planned socialist  economies. The world has witnessed a series of astonishing transitions  as these planned economies moved to introduce market reforms. This  course introduces and applies the basic tools of economic analysis to understand and explore the transitions taking place in these countries. The course focuses principally on China and Russia but will include examples drawn from Eastern Europe and Cuba. Offered many Interims. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 113 Capitalism: The Struggle of Economic Ideas in History</p>
              <p> This  course uses major schools of economic thought and major economic  writers from the past 600 years to introduce principles of economics.  (See Economics 121.) Readings include the architects of capitalism  (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc.), the critics (Karl Marx, Thorstein  Veblen, etc.), and the reformers (J.M. Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter, J.K. Galbraith, etc.). Offered many Interims. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 116 Consumers in Families and Communities </p>
              <p> Consumers,  families, and community are intertwining elements of the social  economy, each depending on the others for success. This course focuses  on the triad, highlighting economic roles and principles. Topics  include the &ldquo;rational consumer,&rdquo; saving and investing, momentous  decisions, prodigal behavior, consumer protection, group dynamics,  nurturing, manipulation, collective purchases, budgeting, voting, and  social welfare. Offered many Interims. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 121 Principles of Economics </p>
              <p> This  course takes an analytical approach to economic reasoning and  contemporary issues. Offered each semester, the course introduces  microeconomic and macroeconomic theories with applications to relevant  topics, such as employment, growth, environmental protection,  affirmative action, exchange rate fluctuations,  taxes, and welfare reform. Students explore economics as an intelligent  approach to understanding our daily lives as citizens, workers,  managers, and consumers. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 122 Analytical Principles of Economics </p>
              <p> This  course covers much the same material as Economics 121, but employs  analytic geometry, set theory, calculus, and computer software to  portray economic perspectives. Prerequisite: Mathematics 119 or 120 or  122. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 233 Economic Methods</p>
              <p> This  course develops the methodological framework which guides economic  inquiry, while it reviews mathematical fundamentals and develops  quantitative skills used in core courses of the major. Students learn  to apply mathematical optimization to economic problems. This course  may substitute for the second  required math course if taken prior to the core courses. Prerequisites:  one of Economics 110-122 and Math 110, 120, or 122. 233 does not count  as a Level II economics analysis class toward the major. Offered  annually. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> CORE COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 261 Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory </p>
              <p> This  course addresses the economic institutions and forces that determine  levels of income, output, employment, and prices in our society.  Questions related to employment prospects and standard of living  provide an important focus. Classical and Keynesian perspectives are  employed in attempting to understand  these matters, the macroeconomics problems in market economies and the  policies that economists prescribe as remedies for these problems.  Prerequisites: Calculus I and one of Economics 110-122, or per-mission of instructor. Offered each semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 262 Intermediate Microeconomic Theory </p>
              <p> Microeconomics  is the study of the resource allocation decisions by households,  producers, and firms and the resources allocation process in various  types of market structures. Students are trained in the use of economic  models and optimizing techniques to address a variety of real-world  problems, including case studies from business and public policy.  Prerequisites: Calculus I and one of Economics 110-122, or permission of instructor. Offered each semester. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> ECONOMIC ANALYSIS COURSES, LEVEL II </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 222 Game Theory in Economics </p>
              <p> Game  theory is the formal study of the strategic interactions between  individuals and between groups of individuals. Game theory has become a  widely adopted tool of analysis in economics, business, law, politics, anthropology, sociology, and international relations. This course introduces students to the theoretical constructs of game theory and focuses on economic applications in the fields of labor economics, international  trade, environmental economics, macroeconomics, and industrial  organization. Prerequisite: Economics 121 or permission of instructor. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 234 American Economic and Business History </p>
