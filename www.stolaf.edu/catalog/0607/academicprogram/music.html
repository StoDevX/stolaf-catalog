              <p class="programdescription"> Inspired  by the conviction that music is a divine gift, the St. Olaf College  Music Department devotes itself to the cultivation of this gift in the  lives of its students and in the broader community.  We dedicate ourselves to creating an educational experience that unites  the artistic standards of a professional program with the intellectual  rigors and academic breadth of the liberal  arts in an environment of free, creative, and critical inquiry. Through  music we affirm the college&rsquo;s mission to foster the development of the  whole person in mind, body, and spirit. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Music Department offers extensive opportunities to explore, practice,  and celebrate the musician&rsquo;s art with an ongoing commitment to a  distinctive ensemble program, excellent individualized instruction, and  a comprehensive undergraduate music curriculum. We honor St. Olaf&rsquo;s  rich heritage spanning more than a century of international artistry  and scholarship and will continue to cultivate a spirit of exploration  and innovation, seeking and celebrating the transcendent and  transforming power of music. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION CREDIT </h5>
              <p> Among the courses that meet the Artistic and Literary Studies requirement of the general education curriculum are: Performance Studies (lessons in voice and instruments), The Art of Music, The Music Spectrum, World Music, Orchestral Music, Music in the Electronic Medium, History of Jazz, and America&rsquo;s Hit Parade. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DEGREES OFFERED </h5>
              <p> The  Music Department offers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Music  (B.M.) degrees, which are accredited by the National Association of  Schools of Music. </p>
              <div>
                <h6> Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music </h6>
                <p> This  is a liberal arts degree, with approximately one-third of the course  work in music. It is available in general music studies or with a  teaching credential or with an emphasis in history-literature or  theory-composition. The breadth of study of a liberal arts degree  offers students a wide range of career options in music and related  fields. Examples include performance, broadcasting, multimedia, arts  administration, advertising, education, arts journalism, music librarianship, or music therapy. This degree also prepares  students to pursue graduate study. Students are admitted to the program  by audition, either as part of their application process or after  beginning their studies at St. Olaf. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6> Bachelor of Music Degree </h6>
                <p> This  is a professional music degree with approximately two-thirds of the  course work in music. Students are admitted to the program by audition,  either as part of their application process or after beginning their  studies at St. Olaf. </p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Bachelor of Music in Performance Students  with this degree often continue with graduate work in preparation for  careers in performance or private and college teaching. This degree is  also a good base for an advanced degree in such fields as pedagogy and  music therapy. Piano and organ performance majors may also pursue an  emphasis in collaborative keyboard performance. </li>
                  <li> Bachelor of Music in Church Music Students in this program usually go on to graduate school or directly into parishes as church musicians. They may also pursue careers in conducting or college teaching or attend seminary to prepare for the ordained ministry. </li>
                  <li> Bachelor of Music in Theory-Composition After  receiving this degree, students typically continue with graduate study.  Other options include work in film music or other media, teaching, or  conducting. </li>
                  <li> Bachelor of Music in Music Education This  degree typically leads to a public school teaching career immediately  after graduation, although graduate study is an option as well. </li>

              <p> Students  wishing to pursue a music major (either B.A. or B.M. degree) are  required to audition on their principal instrument/voice, complete an  examination covering basic music knowledge, and have their keyboard  skills assessed. Students may apply for entrance into the music major  before enrolling at St. Olaf or after beginning their studies here.  Credit for lessons taken before being accepted into the major may count  toward the major. For more information, please contact the Music  Department. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> LESSON FEES </h5>
              <p> The  lesson fee is $340 per semester for each weekly half-hour lesson (0.25  credit). [Refund policy: The fee is refundable only if the student  drops the course by the fifth day of the semester. No refund is given  thereafter.] </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> CANDIDATES FOR TEACHER EDUCATION </h5>
              <p> Applications for the Music Education program, both B.A. and B.M., are processed in the second semester of the sophomore year. All prospective music education students are classified as B.A. music majors until that time. </p>
              <p> Before  applying to the Teacher Education program, the student must have  completed or be enrolled in Music 112 (Ear Training II), Music 114  (Theory II), and Music 251 (Conducting). The application procedure includes a performance in a recital and examinations in conducting (Music 251). </p>
              <p> Students  are reviewed for continuance in the Teacher Education program, usually  in the junior year. The continuance procedure includes a performance in  a recital, a review of conducting and keyboard proficiences, and observations of teaching behavior, which is assessed in Education 330 (Principles of Education). A student not approved for continuance in the program is no longer in that program. (See Music Handbood for details.) </p>
              <p> Students  whose principal performing instrument is piano must perform only on  their secondary instrument/voice (i.e., the one pertaining to music  education licensure) in recital during the entrance and continuance  semesters. They will be assessed on piano via the regular jury system. </p>
              <p> Teacher  licensure requirements may change at any time. If you plan to obtain a  teaching license, you are advised to consult with the Education  Department, Music Education Adviser(s), and department web pages to  ensure that you meet all current requirements. </p>
