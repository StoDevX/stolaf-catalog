              <p class="programdescription"> The  Asian Studies Department provides students with the opportunity to  study East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The department offers  an Asian studies major and concentrations in Asian studies, China studies, and Japan studies. A concentration in Asian studies &mdash;  which presumes that a student completes a major in another department &mdash;  is ideal for students with an interest in Asia who are majoring in  economics, history, religion, anthropology,  art, political science, or other areas. St. Olaf offers many  international programs in Asia. The concentrations in China and Japan  studies allow students to pursue advanced language study with or without an Asian studies major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> An Asian studies major consists of ten courses: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Asian Studies 121 (Asian Cultures in Comparative Perspectives) or Asian Studies 112 (Asian Conversations: The West and East Asia) </li>
                <li> Asian Studies 275 (Interdisciplinary Approaches to Asia, .25 credit) </li>
                <li> Asian Studies 399 (Asian Studies Seminar) </li>
                <li> Four courses in an Asian language (successful completion of Chinese 232, Japanese 232 or equivalent competency) </li>
                <li> Three elective courses concerning Asia. Students who fulfill the language requirement through proficiency testing must still complete seven courses for the major, including Asian Studies 112 or 121, and Asian Studies 399. </li>
              </ol>
              <p> Students  who fulfill the languate requirement through proficiency testing must  still complete seven courses for the major, including Asian Studies 112  or 121, and Asian Studies 399. </p>
              <p> Students  interested in a major focused on a region of Asia other than China and  Japan should contact the chair of the Asian Studies Department about  the possibility of doing a contract major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR CONCENTRATIONS </h5>
              <p> Students with a major in another department may choose a concentration in Asian studies, China studies or Japan studies. Students with Asian studies majors may also choose to do a concentration in China and/or Japan studies. </p>
              <p> An Asian studies concentration consists of six courses: </p>
              <p> 1.	Asian Studies 121 (Asian Cultures in Comparative Perspectives) or Asian Studies 112 (Asian Conversations: East Asia and the West) or, for those returning from a term abroad, an upper level Asian studies course.</p>
              <p> 2.	Five other courses on Asia. No language courses may count toward an Asian studies concentration. A China studies concentration consists of six courses: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Four Chinese language courses above Chinese 112 </li>
                <li> Two other courses on China </li>
              </ol>
              <p> A Japan studies concentration consists of six courses: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Four Japanese language courses above Japanese 112 </li>
                <li> Two other courses on Japan </li>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> Students  are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the many opportunities to  study in Asia through St. Olaf programs and ACM programs. Courses taken  abroad may be certified by the chair of Asian Studies  Department as fulfilling the appropriate course requirements. Language  study is offered through the Term in China (Shanghai), ACM Japan Study  (Tokyo), Ferris University (Yokohama), Nagoya University (Nagoya),  Nagasaki University of Foreign Studies (Nagasaki), and Kansai Gaidai  (Osaka, Japan). The ACM India Studies program (Pune) offers area  studies courses and intensive language instruction without  prerequisites. There are also programs in Asia that do not require  previous language study: Term in Asia, Global Semester, Biology in  South India, Interims, and several study/service opportunities. (See OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS in the Index.) </p>
              <p> Asian  studies courses taken in St. Olaf off-campus programs can often be  counted toward a major in Asian studies or concentrations in Asian  studies, China studies, or Japan studies. Students who wish to count  off-campus courses toward a major or concentration should seek approval  from the chair of the Asian Studies Department before beginning their  programs. Some restrictions apply. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GRADUATE STUDY </h5>
              <p> Students  planning to pursue graduate work in an area of Asian studies are  strongly advised to develop competence in one of the disciplines (such  as history, literature, economics, anthropology, religion, etc.) by  taking additional courses that teach the methods of the discipline. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> ASIAN CONVERSATIONS PROGRAM </p>
              <p> The  Asian Conversations program is an interdisciplinary way to begin a  liberal arts education. Whether you plan to major in biology,  economics, history, Asian studies, or anything else, the Asian  Conversations program offers you an integrated, innovative way to  complete required study in foreign language and the liberal arts. In  the Asian Conversations program about twenty students study Chinese or  Japanese language while they explore the cultures of East Asia through  the interdisciplinary courses listed below (Asian Studies 111, 112, 211  and 212). </p>
              <p> During  the January Interim of their second year, students have the option of  traveling to China and Japan accompanied by an Asian studies faculty  member. A course focusing on the theme &ldquo;National Identity in China and  Japan&rdquo; takes students to sites in China and Japan and offers them the  chance to interact with peers in the Asian language they have studied.  Although this January study tour is not required for Asian  Conversations students, they are given priority in registering. </p>
              <p> Admittance to the Program: Registration for Asian Conversations courses is limited to students admitted into the program. Entering  first-year students receive information about the program soon after  their admission to St. Olaf College. For more details, contact the  chair of the Asian Studies Department. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 111 Asian Conversations: Family and Self in East Asia </p>
              <p> This seminar introduces students to East Asian cultures through the familiar institution of family. In contemporary novels, autobiographies, and short stories, students read about the struggles between traditional ideals and modern pressures as East Asians strive to define themselves within families. The course also develops students&rsquo; writing skills to prepare them for the rest of their college coursework. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 112  Asian Conversations: East Asia and the West </p>
              <p> This  is a history seminar to help students understand the impact that the  West and East Asia have had on each other from the beginning of  sustained contact in the 16th century to the end of World War II. Students  read about and discuss the impact of Christian missionaries, the  economic role of trade, and the political and military challenge of  Western expansionism beginning with the Opium War. Prerequisite: Asian  Studies 111 or permission of the instructor. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 211  Asian Conversations: Rice and Society in East Asia </p>
              <p> Using  rice (and agriculture more generally) as a means of access, this course  introduces students to an examination of the societies, politics, and  economies of East Asian countries. Drawing on social science methods,  it looks at traditional East Asian societies as well as the drive for  modernization and the consequences  that modernization has had on these societies. Prerequisite: Asian  Studies 112 or permission of the instructor. Counts toward the Asian  studies major. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 212  Asian Conversations: National Identity in China and Japan </p>
              <p> In  this Interim course, students who have completed the Asian  Conversations sequence travel to sites in China and Japan in order to  experience those cultures firsthand and to study Chinese and Japanese  constructions of national identity. Through readings, site visits, interactions with peers in the target languages,  homestays, and journal writing in both English and their target  language, students learn about how Asians in these two countries  perceive themselves and their role in the region and in the world, both  in the past and in the present. Prerequisite: Asian Studies 211 or  permission of the instructor. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> OTHER ASIAN STUDIES COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 121 Asian Cultures in Comparitive Perspectives </p>
              <p> This  course examines major cultures of Asia from interdisciplinary and  comparative perspectives with attention to theories of human behavior.  Themes vary from year to year but may include Asian cities, heroic  ideals, village and family life, population growth, gender roles, and  medicine and healing traditions. No prerequisites. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 124 Introduction to Japanese Film (In English Translation) </p>
              <p> This  course studies eight to 10 Japanese films by well-known directors such  as Ozu, Kurosawa, and Itami. Consideration is taken of the way in which  their angle of vision affects the development of themes, such as the  conflict between duty and feeling, the sense of family, or satire of  the family. Includes both historical samurai films and contemporary social problem films. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 126/226 Japanese Language in Society </p>
              <p> This  course explores major aspects of language use that reflect Japanese  culture and society. Issues covered include the characteristics of the  Japanese language, loan words, regional differences, politeness, gender  differences, and communication styles. The course is taught in a  combination of lectures, class discussions, subtitled Japanese films, anime (Japanese animation), and student presentations. There are no pre-requisites  for 126; knowledge of Japanese is helpful but not necessary. Readings,  lectures, and discussions are all in English. The prerequisite for 226  is Japanese 231. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 156 Contemporary China Through Film (In English Translation) </p>
              <p> Students  study basic concepts and approaches of film analysis, while examining  aesthetics, themes, and techniques of masterworks directed by Chinese  Fifth Generation directors. Through readings of cinema theory and  criticism and class discussions, students explore artistic merits in  these films and aspects of Chinese society and culture in contemporary  China, particularly the changes which have occurred since 1978 with  China&rsquo;s Four Modernizations. All readings are in English. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 235 Modern Japanese Literature (In English Translation) </p>
              <p> This  survey of Japanese novels and short stories from the middle of the 19th  century to the present includes works by Soseki, Tanizaki, and two  recent Nobel recipients, Kawabata and Oe. Women writers such as Ichiyo,  Ariyoshi, and Enchi are considered. Students also view four or five  films to supplement their readings. The course focuses on the cultural  context of the writings. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 236 Chinese Literature (In English Translation) </p>
              <p> Students explore the major genres of Chinese literature &mdash; poetry, short story, novel, and drama &mdash; in English translation. A small number of major works are singled out for close attention. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 240 Talking in Japan and the U.S.: Language, Identity and Beyond </p>
              <p> This  course looks at language as it creates and responds to its cultural and  social environments. Students compare and contrast major aspects of  language use in Japan and the United States. Students explore the  general underlying elements of talk (e.g., standard vs. regional  dialects, language attitude and ideologies, politeness, gendered speech  patterns, communication styles) and learn to understand how speakers convey subtle meanings, sometimes unconsciously. Knowledge of Japanese is helpful but not necessary. Taught in English. </p>
