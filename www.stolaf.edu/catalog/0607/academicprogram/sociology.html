              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Samiha Sidhom Peterson, development sociology, family, gender, education, global interdependence, Arab world </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Carolyn R. Anderson, identity, kinship, theory, gender, Native North America, Western Europe, Scandinavia; Grant Arndt, Native North America, religious and social movements, ethnicity; Christopher Chiappari, religion, identity, social change and development, immigration, Latin America; Michael R. Leming, religion, death, family, Thailand and Southeast Asia; Bruce Nordstrom-Loeb, gender, family, race and class; Ryan Sheppard, family, gender, race/ethnicity, social movements; Thomas Williamson, nationalism, ethnicity, globalization, social theory, Southeast Asia </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Sociology  and anthropology share the belief that society and culture shape us in  powerful ways and that we can only know ourselves when we understand  our social and cultural context. Our personalities and choices reflect  who we are, but so do the groups and social institutions to which we  belong (peers, family, religion, politics, occupations). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  grew out of efforts to understand the nature and problems of modern  industrial societies, while anthropology grew out of Europe&rsquo;s  encounters with diverse world cultures. Both seek to explain the  relationships among individuals, groups, institutions, culture, and  meaning; both seek insights into the pressing personal and social  issues of our day. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  and anthropology contribute to current debates in politics, philosophy,  theology, and other areas about multiculturalism, environment, gender,  inequality, &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; development, welfare reform, globalization,  and immigration. All require clear understanding of life&rsquo;s social and cultural dimensions. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Occupations  drawing on sociological and anthropological knowledge include policy  research and planning, human resources and industrial relations, public  and international relations, law, medicine, ministry, counseling,  education, management, social work, and marketing. Both disciplines  also help prepare students for social service and justice work. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  major in sociology/anthropology requires completion of at least nine  courses distributed as follows: five core courses  (Sociology/Anthropology 291, 292, 371, 373, 399) and four elective  courses, including at least one course from the area and topical groups  (230s, 240s) and one from the social structures and processes group  (260s).Transfer students are under the same requirements as students in  their graduating class. Majors are also required to take Statistics 110  (offered by the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science  Department). Statistics 110 is best taken before or simultaneously with  Sociology/Anthropology </p>
              <p> 371. Students are permitted to take one of the four elective courses, but not a core course, S/U. An introductory course is not required but may be used as an elective for the major. </p>
              <p> Students  who study abroad on a St. Olaf program that includes a sociology or  anthropology course may petition to have this course count toward their  major. One independent study/research course or an off-campus field  internship supervised by department faculty may also count toward the  major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION AND PREREQUISITES </h5>
              <p> A  number of Level I and Level II courses count for NBS, MCS-D, MCS-G, or  another general education requirement, and 399 carries EIN credit.  First-year students have enrollment priority in Sociology/Anthropology  121 and 128 unless otherwise indicated in the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedule</a>. There are no prerequisites for 200-level courses; therefore sophomores and above may enroll in them. First-year students are encouraged to take a 100-level course in their first year, but may take 200-level courses after that. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> A  social studies education major with an area of emphasis in  sociology/anthropology is available (see Index). Faculty in the  Sociology/Anthropology Department may be asked to provide academic  supervision  of internships that students arrange in community agencies (see  Sociology/Anthropology 294 and 394). For details on off-campus  programs, see the Index. The Sociology/Anthropology Department is a  core participant in the following interdisciplinary majors: American  studies, American racial and multi-cultural studies, Asian studies, Hispanic studies, social work, nursing, and women&rsquo;s studies. The Sociology/Anthropology Department also contributes towards the Africa and the Americas and the Middle East studies concentrations. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> level I COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 115 The Anthropology of War and Peace </p>
              <p> This  course approaches longstanding questions about the meaning of conflict,  violence, and power in human societies from an anthropological  perspective. The course examines indigenous traditions of conflict  and conviviality and the violence indigenous societies endured in  colonial encounters with the West. Students also consider  anthropological approaches to modern forms of violence including  terrorism, ethnic  cleansing, and state violence. Finally, students examine  anthropological approaches to the analysis of 21st century wars and  contemporary peace movements. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 116 Modern Elixirs: The Anthropology of Mood-Altering Substances </p>
              <p> In  many respects, products like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and opium  provide the glue that holds together modern life. This course examines  the web of these substances from an anthropological perspective. Our  focus includes the politics of production, the culturally diverse  practices of consumption, and the social consequences of regulation.  Based on our collective experience at St. Olaf, we consider the  mood-altering substances on and off campus and examine their influence  in such things as our social identity, individual consciousness and the structure of authority. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 120 Anthropology of Jazz</p>
              <p> In  this course students explore how jazz music and accompanying cultural  forms have reflected as well as shaped American society and culture.  Utilizing photographs, film, music, and texts, they examine how race,  class, and gender structured jazz, as well as politics, urbanization,  migration, and technology. Students look at jazz in terms of social deviance and as a social movement, including its relationship to slavery, segregation and African cultural roots. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 121 Introduction to Sociology</p>
              <p> This  course helps students explore the connections between society and their  own lives. Students answer challenging questions such as &ldquo;Do we have a  &lsquo;human nature&rsquo;?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why does social inequality exist?,&rdquo; &ldquo;What is race?,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;How do societies change?&rdquo; In answering these questions students  learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing so they review  the various research methods and theories that form the sociological  tradition. Offered Fall and Spring Semesters. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 128  Introduction to Cultural Anthropology </p>
              <p> How  do anthropologists study other cultures? Peoples around the world  create different realities through the ways they conceptualize  experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do what they  need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe and compare cultures  and societies, focusing on different aspects such as family and  kinship, inequality and power, religion and values, economy and  technology, and cultural and social change. Offered Fall and Spring  Semesters. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> AREA COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 231 Modern Ireland: Conflict and Change in a Postcolonial Society (Abroad) </p>
              <p> Ireland, renowned for scenic vistas, literary and musical heritage, is also the site of important post-colonial social change. This course examines changes in Irish culture and institutions coinciding with European/global  restructuring and &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; in Northern Ireland. We begin in the  western (Gaeltacht-Irish speaking) rural counties of Galway and Mayo,  move to the Northern Irish city of Derry and conclude in urban Dublin.  Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 234 Native North American Cultures and Religions </p>
              <p> As  an overview of the variety of belief systems and ways of life, this  course explores ethnographic case studies of Native American groups  from the major culture areas of North America north of Mexico. Topics addressed in the course include language families, social organizational systems, ecological and economic  adaptations, material culture, religions and revitalization movements.  The course will also examine the impacts of colonial encounters on  Native American cultures. Offered Fall or Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 236 The Arab World</p>
              <p> Focusing  on present day Arab and Middle Eastern countries, the course explores  the role of the institutions of family and religion in maintaining  continuity, while also identifying sources of change such as the colonial  experience, regional and global interdependence, the social impact of  oil, fundamentalist movements, and the co-existence of traditional and  &ldquo;modern&rdquo; values. Offered Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 237 Forging a Latin American Culture </p>
              <p> This  course explores the forces that shape contemporary Latin America  society, including material and cultural interactions with Europe,  Africa, and the U.S. Emphasis is placed on understanding the formation  of the region in terms of the responses of key groups of actors  (indigenous peoples, women, peasants, workers, the poor,  revolutionaries) to the actions of outside and/or more powerful forces  and institutions (conquerors, the state, the military, missionaries,  multinational corporations). Offered Fall Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 239 Modern Southeast Asia </p>
              <p> Southeast  Asia is a diverse region, stretching from the sleek high-rises of  Singapore to hermetic Rangoon; from Islam to Buddhism; from computer  chip manufacture to swidden agriculture. Students read ethnographies,  novels, and local histories to better understand Southeast Asian family  life, religion, language, and education. Through focusing on the  experience of modernity, students examine how Southeast Asians make  sense of their group affiliations, their pasts, and their futures. The  course aims to challenge contemporary understandings of place, entitlement, and home both in Southeast Asia and beyond. Offered Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> TOPICAL COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 242 Contemporary Native American Issues </p>
              <p> What  do self-determination and cultural identity mean for Native American  peoples today? Students examine the impact of colonization on Native  American peoples, including federal policies, treaty rights, and  sovereignty. Issues include economy and politics on reservations,  family and gender roles, orality and literacy, persistence and  revitalization of religious life and culture, urban life, and recent  social movements and organizations. Offered Fall or Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 245 Social Deviance </p>
              <p> Through  readings addressing a series of topical issues such as youth,  subcultures, gender, organizations, mental health/illness, and  religion, students examine critically various understandings of  deviance. Discussions  address the different interests these notions represent and the  institutions and practices involved in their construction. The course  also explores human agency and collective action in protesting, subvert-ing, and rearticulating the meanings and definitions of what/who is deviant. Offered Fall or Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 248 Sociology of Dying, Death and Bereavement </p>
              <p> This  class investigates death-related behavior from an American and  cross-cultural structural perspective, seeking to understand patterns  of social interaction surrounding and giving meaning to dying, death,  and bereavement. Topics include: death meanings and anxiety, religion  and death-related customs, the dying process, hospice as a social  movement, biomedical issues, the funeral industry, death rituals, and  the social understanding of the bereavement process. Offered Fall  Semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 249 Indigenous Peoples </p>
              <p> Hunters  and gatherers, herders and agriculturalists who have developed  successful strategies for utilizing natural resources while maintaining  ecological balance are in danger of losing their ways of life. Deforestation,  dams, pollution, global warming, desert expansion, and population  pressure &mdash; the products of globalization and economic development &mdash; are  threatening the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as well as  sustainable adaptations. Students explore humans and the environment  and the survival of indigenous peoples. Offered Fall or Spring Semester. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> SOCIAL structures and processes COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 260 Marriage and the Family </p>
              <p> This  course provides a social science understanding of the &ldquo;contemporary  American family&rdquo; and analysis of marriage and family issues from a  cross-cultural perspective. Students discuss issues of dating and mate  selection, marital and parent-child relationships over the family life  cycle, gender issues, work and family roles, and problem-related issues  affecting families (divorce, violence, and death) caused by rapid  changes in society.
