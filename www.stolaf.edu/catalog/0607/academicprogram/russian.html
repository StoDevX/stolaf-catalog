              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  Russian Language and Area Studies Department, in keeping with the  college mission to provide a &ldquo;global perspective,&rdquo; offers a variety of  courses that build upon Russian language proficiency  to give students the knowledge and tools for a successful career.  Recent graduates have entered professions in higher education,  business, government, the church, law, and the arts. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Russia  continues to be a major player in the global community in many areas:  politics, economics, space-age technology, and the development of new  computer software. As the new Russia opens itself to the outside,  college graduates are increasingly sought after for positions in  government service, business and investment, journalism, education, and  social service. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The department offers a major in Russian language and area studies and a major in Russian  language, as well as courses on Russian literature taught in English.  Taking Russian at St. Olaf means more than just taking a language. The  study of Russian introduces you to one of the great cultures of the  world &mdash; the culture of Tchaikovsky, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Kandinsky,  Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, and many others. Russian language is the key  to reading more than one-fourth of all the published scientific  literature in the world. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students  may satisfy general education requirements with Russian studies courses  such as &ldquo;The Russian World.&rdquo; Russian Language and Area Studies 231 or a  higher numbered course taught in the Russian language or demonstrated  proficiency satisfies the foreign language requirement for all  students. Through the ACM, the department participates in an exchange  program with Kuban State University in Russia. Upper level students may  participate in the CIEE program in St. Petersburg and with Novgorod  State University. </p>
