Buckstead, American literature, Asian literature; Karen Cherewatuk, Anglo Saxon, medieval literature; Jenny Dunning, creative writing; Richard DuRocher, Renaissance literature, Milton; Joan Hepburn, African American literature, drama; James Heynen, creative writing; Jonathan E.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Literature  is one of the most compelling ways in which humans have recorded and  reflected on their lives, imagined different worlds, and communicated  one with another. Literature offers the pleasures of artistic  expression combined with the powerful consolations of empathy and  insight, knowledge and inspiration. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  English Department offers a major that, drawing on some 1,500 years of  literatures in English, provides a sound foundation in the history of  British and American literature and introduces students to the more  recent, global range of literatures in English. It contrasts and  connects literatures in English across national boundaries, historical  periods, differing cultures, and the various literary genres. Our  students read from Geoffrey Chaucer to Chinua Achebe, from Mary  Rowlandson to Jamaica Kincaid; they read epics, novels, and plays,  essays and memoirs, lyrics and short stories. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In discussing and writing on what they have read, students develop an informed understanding  of the force of literary language and improve their own powers of  communication, analysis, and persuasion. In the department&rsquo;s creative  writing courses, students can nourish their own verbal creativity and, perhaps, make their own contribution to literatures in English. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  English major is easily and frequently combined with other majors.  English courses also count toward general education requirements (see  below) and contribute to a number of interdisciplinary concentrations,  including American racial and multicultural studies, American  studies, medieval studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. The English major is  very compatible with off-campus and overseas study (see below under  Special Programs), since most courses taken elsewhere in literature in  English can count toward the major as electives. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> What can you do with an English major? Students who wish to teach English at the secondary  school level use their major towards a Communication Arts and  Literature License. Most English majors use their powers of critical  thinking, verbal comprehension, reading, writing, and speaking to enter  a wide range of jobs, occupations, training programs, and professions. They find that what their English major gave them is good for the marketplace and good for a lifetime. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  basic English major is nine courses. All majors complete the same four  courses: English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a category  designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo; (GLE). With  the remaining five (or more) electives, two of which must be at Level  III, students can pursue their own particular interests and give their  major the emphasis they choose, whether particular authors, historical periods, genres or topics, or a focus on creative writing. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
              <p> Many English courses carry general education credit in ALS-L, HWC, MCS-G and MCS-D, ORC, WRI, and EIN. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> PREREQUISITES </h5>
              <p> General  Education 111 or its equivalent is a prerequisite for all other courses  in the department except English 107, 110 and some Level I Interim  courses. While a few courses have additional prerequisites, most Level  I and Level II courses are open to all &mdash; majors and non-majors alike &mdash;  after General Education  111. Level III courses (numbered 300 or higher) are primarily for  English majors and ordinarily build upon prior work. All Level III  courses require as a prerequisite English 185 and at least one Level II  course in an area of relevant background as confirmed by the instructor  or the department. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> Requirements for the Graduation Major </h6>
                <p> Nine  English courses including English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a  category designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo;  (GLE); plus five electives (two of which must be at Level III).  Supplementary courses in disciplines such as classics, history,  philosophy, and modern foreign languages are recommended for all majors. </p>
                <p> GLE  courses are offered at both Level II and III and may be taken at any  time during the major. Courses in this category are global in scope  (that is, not confined to, although they may include, literature  written in Great Britain and the USA). GLE courses emphasize the  multicultural, transnational, and post-colonial  nature of much literature written in English. A list of courses meeting  this requirement will be posted on the department website. </p>
                <p> Requirements for the Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure plus English Graduation Major </p>
                <p> Eight  English courses including English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a  category designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo;  (GLE); 233; 251 or 257; 274; and one Level III literature elective;  Theatre 100, 120; Media Studies 160; plus the requirements in  professional education, including Education 321 and 345. (Consult the CAL Licensure Adviser.) </p>
                <p> Requirements for the Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure </p>
                <p> Four  English courses including English 185; 251 or 257; 274; and one English  literature elective; two of Theatre 100, 115, 120, 130; Media Studies  160; plus the requirements in professional education, including Education 321 and 345. (Consult the CAL Licensure Adviser.) </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> The  English Department awards distinction on the basis of a student&rsquo;s  overall record in the department and on the quality of a written  project &ndash; critical or creative &ndash; submitted by the candidate in his or  her senior  year. To be a candidate for departmental distinction, a student must  have completed a minimum of seven graded St. Olaf English courses whose  combined GPA is no lower than 3.5. Such students may apply at the  beginning of either the Fall Semester or the Spring Semester of their  senior year. Students interested in distinction should obtain  guidelines from the Department Distinction Coordinator and find a  supervisor in the English Department before applying. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> Special  programs include semester and full-year study in England at Oxford,  Lancaster, and East Anglia; study in Scotland at Aberdeen; semester and  full-year study in Ireland at Trinity College, University College  Dublin and University College Galway; Interim study in the Caribbean  and in Ireland; semester and Interim study at the Newberry Library in  Chicago; Urban Teaching semester in Chicago; Interim theater study in  London; internships in writing. (See INTERNATIONAL AND OFF-CAMPUS  STUDIES for further information.) </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY </h5>
              <p> Students  planning on graduate study in English should take the graduation major  and additional courses for a total not to exceed 14. Specific programs  should be planned with the student&rsquo;s academic adviser. At least two  foreign languages should be included, one of which should be French or  German. In recent years, English majors have been accepted for graduate  study in literature (at Berkeley, Chicago, Princeton, Toronto,  Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin) and in writing (at Boston  University, George Mason, Iowa, and Virginia). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p> Level  II courses (numbered in the 200s) are open to all students without  prerequisite beyond General Education 111 or its equivalent. Level III  courses (numbered in the 300s) are primarily confined to the major,  demand control of methods and of basic factual and theoretical  knowledge appropriate to English studies, require more advanced work,  assume more preparation, and pursue subjects in greater depth than do  Level II courses. Level III courses are open to students with the  stated prerequisites. </p>
              <p> Courses  in writing provide the opportunity for students, whether beginning or  experienced writers, to develop their own work in a variety of modes  including poetry, journalism, creative nonfiction, drama, and fiction  for both beginning and experienced writers. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> LITERARY STUDIES </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 108 The Hero and the Trickster in Post-Colonial Literature </p>
              <p> Students  examine various heroic and trickster figures as manifested in  post-colonial literature from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, both oral  and written, and seek to understand what basic human needs and realities these figures express and fulfill. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 123 Introduction to Poetry </p>
              <p> This  course introduces students to poetry from a range of perspectives  including, but not limited to: the poet&rsquo;s life; the application of  categories of analysis such as race, gender, and nationality; poetry as  literary craft; and the aesthetic appreciation of poems. To  &ldquo;experience&rdquo; the literary medium of poetry in the fullest sense,  students are required to write about, memorize, orally  interpret/recite, and compose their own poetry. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 124 Introduction to Drama </p>
              <p> This  course introduces students to literary analysis through dramatic texts  and performance. Activities may include trips to see local productions,  student in-class performances, staged readings, and viewing filmed  productions. Plays are drawn from varied genres, two or more historical  periods, and both traditional and experimental approaches. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 131 The Comic Novel </p>
              <p> Students  analyze the forms, uses, and targets of humor and satire in fiction as  well as the genre&rsquo;s social and political purposes during the period of  the rise of the novel in Europe. Students explore English, Irish, and  French comic fiction such as Swift&rsquo;s Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, Voltaire&rsquo;s Candide, Fielding&rsquo;s Joseph Andrews, Edge-worth&rsquo;s Castle Rackrent, and Austen&rsquo;s Pride and Prejudice. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 132 Reading for Life </p>
              <p> Students  develop skills to make reading a source of lifelong satisfaction. Six  to eight works of fiction and nonfiction are read, including such works  as Chinua Achebe&rsquo;s Arrow of God, Bronte&rsquo;s Wuthering Heights and Anne Fadiman&rsquo;s The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down. Students may write book reviews, background pieces, and reflective essays. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 135 Southern Women Writers </p>
              <p> This  course explores fiction and drama by 20th-century Southern women  against the background of their cultural heritage. The complex and  distinctive relations of race, social class, and gender of the South  form a rich and highly problematic inheritance for all Southern women.  Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 155 Literature Alive! Writing for Social Change </p>
              <p> Literature  Alive! explores the relationships between literature and social change.  The course is divided between two weeks on campus, reading, discussing,  and writing about selected literary works engaged in social protest and  change, and two weeks in Minneapolis and St. Paul, meeting with  writers, actors, and publishers, and attending workshops, performances,  and readings. The literature engages in some of the central, still  ongoing American conversations about the relations of our shared ideals  of freedom, equality, and individualism to such social categories as  race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender.
