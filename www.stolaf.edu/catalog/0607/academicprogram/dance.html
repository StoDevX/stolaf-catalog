              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Janice Roberts, modern dance, choreography, improvisation, Companydance </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Jennifer Bader, ballet; Susan Bauer, movement analysis; Heather Klopchin, dance history, ballet, senior seminar, Companydance; Anthony Roberts, modern dance, dance technology, Companydance; Sherry Saterstrom, dance/movement technique, somatic studies, improvisation ensem-ble; Anne von Bibra, dance ethnology, ballroom, Veselica International Dance Ensemble </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Dancing  is moving, exploring, creating, knowing ourselves as whole people.  Since time began, dance has threaded itself through the fabric of  personal, social, cultural, and religious tradi-tions.  It excites, invigorates, and entices us, echoing our life experiences.  Dance reflects our human desire to shape feelings, ideas, and images  with an aesthetic sensibility. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Creating  dance opens up new connections within ourselves, with others, and with  entire communities. At St. Olaf we lace together a dance experience  which emphasizes the Ameri-can modern dance tradition in its technical training, while encouraging study and perform-ance  of styles and dances from world cultures. Performance opportunities  range from main-stage productions to informal showings, from chapel  services to off campus events. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In  combining studio and theory work, the dance major prepares students for  a variety of life and career possibilities. Recent graduates perform  with professional companies or as free-lance  artists. Others pursue post-graduate study in dance therapy or the  somatic disciplines. The emerging field of dance medicine will beckon  many in the future, as will careers in arts/dance administration, dance  in the church, or teaching in public schools, private studios, or  community service agencies. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> St. Olaf is a charter member and an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Dance  100, 124, 201, 231, 232, 246, and 399 are the required core courses. In  addition, students select the equivalent of 1.5 courses in technique in  consultation with dance faculty. Each student also designs an  individualized area of specialty related to a core course and  consisting of at least two additional courses selected from within  and/or outside the department. A senior project completes the area of  specialty. Sam-ple  specialties include performance-choreography, body-mind studies, and  history and ethnology. The dance major is compatible with other majors. </p>
              <p> Majors  are expected to participate in one of the dance companies (Companydance  or Veselica) in both performance and production roles. Participation  must be planned in consultation with the dance faculty. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> DANCE TEACHING LICENSE </h5>
              <p> St.  Olaf is requesting approval from the Minnesota Board of Teaching to  offer a K-12 teaching license in dance. This would be effective for the  class of 2007. Board approval is pending. Contact Dance faculty member  Sherry Saterstrom or Mark Schelske, Education Department chair, for  further information. </p>
