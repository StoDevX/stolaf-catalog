                <p class="programdescription"> Hispanic studies offers an interdisciplinary structure for the systematic study of Latin America,  Spain, and U.S. Latinos, whose distinct geography and cultures are  unified by elements of a common heritage. Profound geographic  variations, differing economic resources, and the interactions of  Hispanic and indigenous cultures have yielded complex and diverse  Spanish-speaking societies. Increasing socioeconomic contacts between  states and societies in the Americas and the growing presence of  Latinos in this country underscore the need for U.S. citizens to deepen  their understanding of the region. In doing so, students also find  opportunities for reflecting on their own culture and society. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
                <p> The  requirements for the completion of a Hispanic studies major consist of  eight courses: Spanish 270 or 271; Spanish 272, 273, or 274 (or a  substitute course approved by the director of Hispanic studies); Hispanic  Studies 333, and five approved courses dealing with Latin America,  Spain, or U.S. Latinos. These courses may be chosen from among history,  economics, anthropology, sociology, political science, religion, and art, with no more than two courses in any one discipline. </p>
                <p> Students  may count one Independent Research study towards the major, and they  may also count up to three study-abroad courses taken in Latin America  or Spain. With the approval of the Hispanic studies director, students may have any course with a substantial Hispanic content counted toward their major. </p>
                <div>
                  <h6> Requirements for the Latin American/ Latino Studies Concentration </h6>
                  <p> Students  majoring in any discipline who have an interest in Latin America and  U.S. Latinos can pursue a &ldquo;Latin American/Latino studies&rdquo;  concentration, which enables them to enhance their understanding of the  Latin American countries and peoples, U.S. Latinos, and the  interconnectedness of Latin America and the United States. Topics  explored might include: the nature of social and political change,  economic development, social mobility and discrimination, the role of  women in society, the changing nature of Hispanic life, patterns of  migration, and adaptation and challenges to cultural and artistic  traditions. </p>
                  <p> This  interdisciplinary concentration is an individual contract negotiated  between the student and the director of Hispanic studies. Hispanic  studies majors may not obtain a concentration in Latin American/ Latino  studies. </p>
                  <p> A  minimum of five approved courses, subject to the following  requirements, must be taken for the concentration. One of the courses  must be the interdisciplinary seminar, Hispanic Studies 333, Contemporary Issues in Latin America. A maximum of two courses in a given discipline may be counted. A maximum of two courses from off-campus programs may be counted. Either  Sociology 244 or ARMS 121 may be included in the concentration, but not  both. An interdisciplinary paper focusing on a theme related to the  concentration must be written for one of the courses offered for the  concentration. This paper will be developed in consultation with  faculty advisers from two different disciplines. </p>

                <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
                <p> Hispanic  studies majors are encouraged to take advantage of the many off-campus  programs available to them. Foreign study opportunities in the Hispanic  area currently offered to St. Olaf students include: interims in Costa  Rica, Ecuador, and Spain; the CIEE Program in Seville, Spain; the ACM  Programs in Costa Rica, HECUA programs in Guatemala and Ecuador; and  the SPAN Program in Latin America. Students must secure prior approval  for foreign study from the director of Hispanic studies. </p>
                <p> Hispanic studies faculty members participate in the Foreign Language Across the Curriculum program,  which offers students the opportunity to use their foreign language  skills in selected courses. (See FOREIGN LANGUAGES ACROSS THE  CURRICULUM under Academic Programs in this catalog.) </p>
