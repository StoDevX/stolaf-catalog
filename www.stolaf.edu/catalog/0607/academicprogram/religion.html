Barbour, religion and literature, ethics; David Booth, theology; Elizabeth Galbraith, theology; Amy Gohdes-Luhman, Bible; James Hanson, New Testament; Peder Jothen, ethics; Eric Lund, history of Christianity; Margaret Odell, Old Testament; Natan Paradise, Judaism; William R.

                <p> <span class="programdescription">The  study of religion is an integral part of the liberal arts curriculum  because religion has always been a major influence on the development  of human societies. In order to make sense of past cultural  achievements, it is important to recognize the influence of religious  symbols, beliefs, rituals, scriptural texts, and traditions. To  participate meaningfully in contemporary culture, it is equally  important to evaluate the merits of various theological beliefs and religious values. </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> All St. Olaf students take courses that orient them in a general way to the study of religion  and acquaint them with the principal elements of the Christian  tradition. The religion department also makes available a range of  courses about Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism in order to  prepare students to live in our religiously diverse world. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Since  the study of religion involves the use of a variety of methodologies  and intersects with many other fields of study, students often find  that a major in religion helps them integrate their work in other  disciplines and develop a focus for their whole liberal arts education.  Many students also choose to major in religion as a preparation for  seminary or graduate work in religion. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION CREDIT </h5>
                <p> Religion  courses fulfill a variety of general education requirements. The  department offers several options to complete the Biblical Studies,  Theological Studies, and Ethical Issues requirements. Additional  courses count as Historical Studies in Western Culture, Multicultural  Studies, and Literary Studies. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
                <p> The  religion major consists of eight courses and requires both broad  exposure to major approaches to studying religion and concentrated  study in some aspect of religion. The requirements are organized in  four parts: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li> General education courses in religion: Religion 121 [BTS-B] and a course in theological studies [BTS-T]. </li>
                  <li> Study  of at least two religious traditions using three different academic  approaches: a) sacred texts, b) religion in history and culture, and c)  religious thought. </li>
                  <li> Intensive studies in religion: At least two Level III courses, at least one of which must be a seminar. </li>
                  <li> Elective courses. </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
                <p> Religion majors may graduate with distinction if their grade point average is 3.5 in religion and 3.0 over-all,  and they submit a research project that meets the approval of a  departmental review committee. The Junia Prize is usually awarded  annually to the best distinction project of the year. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
                <p> The  Religion Department participates in Foreign Language Across the  Curriculum Program, which offers students the opportunity to use their  foreign language skills in selected courses. (See FLAC under Academic Programs.) Each year the department offers Interims abroad, some carrying general education credit. </p>
              </div>
              <div>

The course focuses especially upon language and  images of God, the person of Christ and the work of redemption  and understandings of human nature. Students evaluate arguments for and  against the compatibility of Christianity and feminism. Prerequisite:  BTS-B. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 212 Christian Theology in Historical Context </p>
                <p> This  course offers an overview of the development of Christian thought and  practice in the ancient, medieval and modern periods and analyzes the  way Christian beliefs have evolved in response to changing historical situations.

                <p class="coursename"> 214 Reformation Theology </p>
                <p> Students  analyze 16th-century reform movements in light of their theological and  historical contexts and their significance for contemporary theology.  The course focuses on contributions and lives of the major figures in  the Protestant Reformations (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, etc.) and the  Roman Catholic Reform, with special attention to doctrines of Christ,  salvation and the Spirit, and to the question of religious authority.

                <p class="coursename"> 223 Paul: His Letters, His Gospel </p>
                <p> Students  read Pauline letters carefully for their major issues, such as  apocalyptic, gospel, apostleship, Jew and Gentile, faith, Torah,  community. Considering Paul in the context of his times and Paul in the  context  of later Christianity, students discuss topics such as Jews and  Christians, men and women, creation, grace in Paul and present day  experience. Prerequisite: BTS-B. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 225 God and Human Suffering </p>
                <p> Why  does human life involve suffering? If God is omnipotent and good, why  does evil exist? Is God responsible, or can all evil &mdash; and the  suffering that accompanies it &mdash; be explained by sin or human frailty.  Students will explore some of the ways that Christian theology had  attempted to respond to these questions, and they will also examine  challenges to the Christian perspective. Prerequisite: BTS-B. </p>
                <p class="coursename"> 226 Christian Theology and Visual Art </p>
                <p> Christian  theological reflection on the significance of visual art and  consideration of selected art works as visual expressions of  theological meaning.
