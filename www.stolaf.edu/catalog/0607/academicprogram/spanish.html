              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Maggie A. Broner (Romance Languages), Hispanic and applied linguistics, Spanish in the U.S.; Sylvia Graciela Carullo (Romance Languages), colonial and 20th-century Spanish-American literature, Hispanic culture; Kris Cropsey (Romance Languages), Hispanic linguistics, second language acquisition; Juliet Lynd (Romance Languages), Hispanic literature and culture; Joseph McClanahan (Romance Languages) peninsular literature, culture and film; Le&oacute;n Narv&aacute;ez (Romance Languages), cross-cultural analysis, Hispanic literature, dialects of Spanish; Barbara Olson (Romance Languages), second language acquisition; Ariel Strichartz (Romance Languages), Latin American literature and culture </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Students  who study Spanish become explorers in many dimensions. They discover,  among other things, that Spanish represents less an alternative means  for expressing what we see and think than a cultural lens predisposing  and empowering its speakers to see and think in unique ways. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> On looking through this lens, students diversify their perceptions of the world and multiply  their opportunities for interacting with it. These opportunities may  include experiencing the tragic ferocity of the Spanish Civil War in  the pages of Sender&rsquo;s R&eacute;quiem por un campesino espa&ntilde;ol, serving as an  interpreter for a Latino family in Northfield, teaching art to the  children of imprisoned women in Quito, Ecuador, speaking with  indigenous people on the shores of Guatemala&rsquo;s beautiful Lake Atitl&aacute;n  about their struggle to preserve the land, probing the imposing  complexity of Latin American life within the mythic dimensions of  Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez&rsquo;s Macondo, debating politics with impassioned university  students in Seville, Spain, or talking into the night with a roommate  from Costa Rica in the Spanish House. Whatever the channels opened &mdash;  and they are countless &mdash; students who become proficient in Spanish discover that &ldquo;Quien sabe dos lenguas, vale por dos.&rdquo; </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> To encourage students to speak Spanish outside the classroom, the department organizes a weekly Spanish conversation table and administers an Honor House (Casa Hisp&aacute;nica) which serves as a venue for lectures and cultural and social activities &mdash; facilitated by a resident native speaker of Spanish &mdash; with Hispanic  themes. In addition, Spanish faculty collaborate with colleagues in  other disciplines in developing and teaching courses with a Foreign  Language Across the Curriculum credit. These courses enable students  who have completed the fourth semester of college Spanish to apply and  develop their proficiency in Spanish across the curriculum. </p>
              <p> St.  Olaf also operates its own Interims in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Spain  and affiliates with long-established consortia &mdash; notably the ACM, CIEE,  and HECUA &mdash; which administer semester programs in Spain and Central and  South America, as well as off-campus programs in the United States. </p>
