              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/psych/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/psych/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2006-07:</strong> Dana L. Gross, developmental psychology </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Deborah J. Anderson, clinical and health psychology; Harry Brull, industrial/organizational psychology; Shelly Dickinson, behavioral neuroscience; Scott Gregory, industrial/organizational psychology; Jumi Hayaki, clinical psychology; Charles W. Huff, Jr., social psychology, social and ethical issues in computing; Donna McMillan, personality psychology, clinical psychology; Gary Muir, neuroscience, spatial cognition; Annie Murray-Close, developmental psychology; Michael E. Sadler, personality psychology; Bonnie S. Sherman, experimental psychology, perception and neuropsychology; Howard I. Thorsheim, human cognition, learning, performance and systems </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  Department of Psychology is committed to maintaining a rigorous  academic curriculum within a supportive community structure. It seeks  to address broad questions posed by a liberal education and specific concerns of individual students. St. Olaf College&rsquo;s mission statement  provides a framework for curriculum, personal development, and  community relations. Because life is more than facts and theories, the  Psychology Department encourages students to be &ldquo;responsible citizens  dedicated to service,&rdquo; as well as scientific &ldquo;seekers of truth.&rdquo; </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Ten psychology courses contribute to general education by fulfilling both foundation studies  (ORC and WRI) and core studies (HBS, NSL, NST, MCS-D, MCS-G). They  introduce the disciplinary knowledge that nurtures growth and  behavioral change while providing background for advanced study.  Psychology contributes to majors in social work, family studies,  and nursing, to concentrations in linguistics, neuroscience, and  women&rsquo;s studies and to the psychology core of the social studies  education major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Psychology  majors are prepared for graduate and professional programs in  psychology, medicine, law, physical therapy, social work, nursing, and  ministry and for entering positions in business, government, or  industry. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The Department of Psychology follows the American Psychological Association&rsquo;s guidelines of &ldquo;synthesizing  the natural and social science aspects of the discipline, in part, by  requiring students to take courses in both knowledge bases.&rdquo; Thus both  interpersonal and investigative skills are enhanced. Students benefit  from research in the library, laboratory, and field, as well as from  internships. Through course structure and faculty diversity, the  department challenges students to think critically and creatively as  they investigate  ways in which animals, especially humans, adapt to their environment  through biological, social, emotional, spiritual, perceptual,  behavioral, linguistic, and cognitive processes. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Psychology  majors are required to take 12.5 courses to complete the major. The  major consists of 9.25 courses in the Department of Psychology with  three courses from other departments. </p>
              <p> The  requirements fall into five categories: foundational courses in the  major, content core courses, Level III capstone courses, an elective  course in the department, and general education requirements for the  major. </p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Distinction  in the major is awarded based on a portfolio that the major submits to  the department for judging. The submitted portfolio consists of: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> The major&rsquo;s course transcript and psychology GPA </li>
                <li> An annotated history of relevant experiences, written by the student </li>
                <li> The candidate&rsquo;s personal statement </li>
                <li> A major paper </li>
              </ul>
              <p> Further detail about the distinction process and the portfolio can be found on the Department of Psychology web pages. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  Psychology Club, open to all students interested in psychology, is an  active organization on campus, as is Psi Chi, the national honor  society in psychology. Together they offer group activities of psychological interest. Psychology majors are eligible for affiliate membership in the American Psychological Association and to receive its publications and announcements. </p>
              <p> Special  study programs include the Social Studies Education Program with a  major in psychology and internships programs to pursue special areas of  interest in the field. </p>
              <p> Research groups in the department allow students to participate in research as a part of a group following a research program associated with a faculty member. Participation in these research groups allows students  to learn how research is done in psychology, to practice the skills  they will need in graduate school and other employment and to begin the  process of becoming a psychologist. Often the research done in research  groups is presented as posters at national and regional conferences and  is published in professional journals. </p>
              <p> Departmental honors and awards include the Gordon Allport Award granted each spring to the junior  whose aspirations are in basic sympathy with Allport&rsquo;s views and who  has made efforts to develop his or her own talents, interests, and  personalities toward fulfilling his or her individual potential. A  Psychology Endowment Fund provides funding for equipment and supplies for students undertaking research in the department. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"> 125 Principles of Psychology </p>
              <p> This  course examines the basic principles and methods of psychological  science from an evolutionary and cultural perspective. Students use  critical thinking skills to examine fascinating topics: dreaming,  cultural influences, identity, learning, thinking, and the biology of  behavior. Applying basic research methods, students act as skeptical scientists. This course applies to almost any career choice in today&rsquo;s world and provides insight into self and others. Offered each semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 126 Investigative Explorations in Psychology </p>
              <p> Students engage in hands-on laboratory experiments to (1) understand the experimental basis of current scientific  theory in psychology; and (2) develop proficiency in using equipment,  testing hypotheses, collecting data, and interpreting results.  Phenomena selected for these introductory investigations are robust,  central to introductory psychology, of interest to students, and  relevant to psychological research. Prerequisite/corequisite: Psychology 125. Offered each semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 225 Psychophysiology</p>
              <p> Psychophysiology,  an area of cognitive neuroscience, reveals new insights about cognition  and emotions by measuring corresponding changes in physiological  activity such as brain waves, heart rate, muscle tone, body  temperature, and blood pressure. Students gain hands-on laboratory  experience and training in techniques of electro-encephalography,  electro-cardiology, electromyography, skin temperature measurement, and biofeedback. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. Offered during Interim. [SHORTENED TO MEET CATALOG PARAMETERS. OKAY?] </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 226 Human Development in East Asia: Perspectives from China and Japan </p>
              <p> Students reflect on their own culture as they explore childhood and family life in China and Japan. Developmental  and cross-cultural research, memoirs, works of fiction, and films are  used to study parents&rsquo; beliefs and childrearing practices as well as  the development of the self, peer relationships, school achievement,  and role changes during adulthood. With life expectancy increasing  around the world, students also discover how China and Japan are  responding to the graying of their populations. Prerequisites: Psychol-ogy 125 or Asian Studies 111 or Asian Studies 121. Offered during Interim. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 231 Research Methods in Psychology </p>
              <p> This course prepares the student with tools for understanding how research studies in psychology are conceptualized, designed, carried out, interpreted, and disseminated to the public. Use of library and Internet  resources, ethical guidelines in the conduct of research and the skills  of good scientific writing will be emphasized. Students work  independently and in small groups to design and conduct their own  research projects. Prerequisites: Psychology 125, Statistics 110, 212,  or 263. Offered each semester. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 235 Sensation and Perception </p>
              <p> This  course offers the opportunity to study our senses and sensibilities &mdash;  sensations of cold, tenderness and pain, perceptions of movement,  pitch, symmetry, and color. Students participate actively in psychophysical,  physiological, and perceptual laboratories and classes on vision,  audition, somesthesis, and the chemical senses. Laboratory and other  independent work is required. Students attend three hours lecture and three hours laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. Offered each year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 236 Conditioning and Learning </p>
              <p> How  do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning  process? While some emphasis will be on analysis of the behavioral  viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students will also examine approaches to  how we learn which have grown out of recent cognitive and ecological  (evolutionary) perspectives in psychology. The course includes lecture and laboratory work with nonhuman animals. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. Offered each year. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 237 Cognition, Learning and Memory</p>
              <p>Focus  includes information processing, learning and remembering speech,  artistic, musical and athletic performance, invention and other forms  of creativity.
