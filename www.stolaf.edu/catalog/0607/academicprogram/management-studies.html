              <h2 class="programname"> Management Studies<br>
              </h2>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2006-07:</strong> Richard M. Goedde (Economics), finance, investments, management, managerial accounting </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2006-07:</strong> Siri Chutikamoltham (Economics), management; Mary Ann Emery (Economics), financial accounting, intermediate accounting, personal finance; Sian Muir (Economics), entrepreneurship; Kathy Gardner Thomforde (Economics), management, marketing, management strategy </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Management  studies is a multidisciplinary program offering a contract  concentration in management studies that can be earned in conjunction  with any B.A. academic major. Individual  contracting encourages students to consider personal goals as they  design a program of courses in management studies, economics, and other  disciplines. The Management Studies Program also supports the  management and finance areas of emphasis within the economics major  (see Department of Economics). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> To meet the challenges of an ever-changing world, graduates must be ready to take advantage of opportunities and create their own success. A St. Olaf liberal arts education encourages students to view the world from multiple perspectives, build fundamental communication and problem-solving skills, wrestle with questions of ethics, and develop a global perspective. The management studies concentration connects theory and practice and helps students make the transition from college to career. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  management studies concentration prepares students for careers in  domestic and international business, not-for-profit and governmental  organizations, and entrepreneurial ventures. Students direct their  efforts by choosing elective courses and experiences that focus on a  special area of interest. For example: a student who hopes to start a  business can elect to take Management Studies 256 (Entrepreneurship),  participate in the Estenson Internship Program  which provides a paid summer internship in an entrepreneurial firm, and  apply for a Finstad grant to pursue a business idea. (See information  about the Finstad Program for Entrepreneurial Studies below.) </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR A MANAGEMENT STUDIES CONCENTRATION </h5>
                <p> The management studies concentration is arranged by individual contract. The concentration includes </p>
                <p> (1) a five-course program of study, (2) Experiential Learning, and (3) an Electronic Integrative Folder. </p>
                <div>
                  <h6> Course Requirements: </h6>
                  <p> Students  meet with a member of the management studies faculty to develop a  five-course program of study which includes three core and two elective  courses. Core courses for the management studies concentration  include Economics 121 or 122, and Management Studies 225 and 251.  Electives include an additional management studies course and an  approved course from another department on campus or a study abroad  program. Students must earn a grade of C or better in the five courses. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h6> Experiential Learning: </h6>
                  <p> This requirement is satisfied by completing two approved experiences in which the student applies management or financial principles to real world problems. One of the activities must be a full credit equivalent Academic Internship or an approved work experience. The other activity can be a volunteer, leadership, entrepreneurial, or related work experience. The Internship Office, Office for Career Connections, Finstad Program for Entrepreneurial Studies, and other organizations help students complete this requirement. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h6> The Electronic Integrative Folder: </h6>
                  <p> The  Electronic Integrative Folder introduces students to the career  planning process, helping them to identify career options and access  opportunities. The folder includes the results of self-assessment and  career exploration activities, a description of future goals, and an  academic and experiential action plan, as well as projects, papers, and  other work that demonstrate specific skill development. The Integrative  Folder is presented on a CD. By interconnecting important pieces in a  digital folder, students can demonstrate the interrelatedness of their varied learning experiences. </p>
