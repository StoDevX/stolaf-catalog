              <p> <span class="programdescription">St.  Olaf traditionally graduates more chemistry majors than any other  four-year college in the United States. The college also ranks in the  top five as a source of students who obtain the Ph.D. in chemistry and  related fields. Chemistry faculty members have a fine record of  achievement in teaching and research; several have won prestigious  national awards. Students enjoy state-of-the-art instrumentation and computers in both laboratory and classroom. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Chemistry Department offers an array of courses in the traditional  areas of chemistry (organic, analytical, physical, inorganic). Courses  in biochemistry, organometallic chemistry, environmental chemistry, and  other topics introduce students to interdisciplinary and bridging sciences that utilize a chemical perspective. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  department has an active summer research program, in which faculty and  students work together to investigate problems of current interest.  Students graduating with chemistry majors have had excellent success in  gaining admission to graduate and professional schools and in obtaining  employment opportunities. A major in chemistry may lead to employment  in chemical research and in related areas such as medical applications  of chemistry, environmental chemistry, and materials science. A chemistry major also provides an excellent background for continued education in professional schools in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and related fields. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> Requirements for a Graduation Major </h6>
                <p> Majors  must complete Chemistry 125 (or 121 and 123), 126, 247, 248, 255, 371,  laboratory courses 253, 254, 256, 357, and one additional course from  252, 260, 379, 380, 382, 386, 388, or 391. In addition,  students majoring in chemistry must take either Physics 124L and 125L  (2.0 credits), or Physics 126L, 127L, and 228/229L (3.25 credits);  Mathematics through courses 126 or 128; and attendance during junior and senior years at 12 departmental seminars. Completion of at least one course credit in independent research (or having a summer research experience) is strongly recommended for students planning careers in chemistry. For more information, see www.stolaf.edu/depts/chemistry/major/index.html. </p>
                <p> Requirements for a Physical Science Teacher Major (with a Chemistry Concentration) </p>
                <p> A chemistry major who wishes to teach chemistry in schools (5-12) must hold a valid Minnesota teaching license in physical science with a chemistry concentration. In addition to the chemistry major, additional science courses and the professional education sequence are required. Interested students should consult  with a faculty advisor in the Education Department for details of  requirements and available options. A physical science teaching minor  is available. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY </h5>
              <p> St.  Olaf College is accredited by the American Chemical Society through its  Committee on Professional Training. Prospective majors in chemistry who  expect to comply with the minimum requirements of the committee will  take the following courses: Chemistry 125 (or 121 and 123), 126, 247,  248, 253, 254, 255, 256, 357, 371, 378, 379, 382, 386, and at least  1.25 additional laboratory credits selected from 373, 374, 375, 380,  391 (when taught as Bioanalytical Chemistry), or 398. In addition,  ACS-certified majors are required to take two mathematics courses  beyond calculus II (Mathematics 126 or 128). This requirement is typically fulfilled by taking Mathematics 220 and one of Mathematics 226 or 230. </p>
              <p> Students  planning graduate work in chemistry should complete most of these  courses, even if they do not fulfill all of the requirements for ACS  certification. In particular, students interested in graduate school  should take Chemistry 386 by the end of the junior year so that they  have taken the background courses relevant to the Chemistry Graduate  Record Examination prior to fall of the senior year, when that  examination is typically taken. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> The  Chemistry Department seeks to encourage and recognize students who give  evidence of creative and independent scholarship. A variety of  opportunities are available for students to take a much greater  responsibility for setting their goals and realizing the achievements  of their education. Going beyond the regular course work, which  introduces the theory and practice of chemistry, distinction challenges  students  to raise questions worthy of scientific investigation. Opportunities  for distinction projects include, for example, summer research either  on or off campus, Level II Independent Study (Chemistry 298), Level III  Independent Research (Chemistry 398), Advanced Laboratory (Chemistry  375), and faculty-approved literature research projects. All projects  for distinction will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p>
              <p> A full description of the distinction process is available at www.stolaf.edu/depts/chemistry/major/ index.html. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> St.  Olaf chemistry majors have a number of options for special study, both  on campus and elsewhere. On-campus programs that may include chemistry  topics include concentrations in biomolecular science, envrionmental  studies, neuroscience, and biomedical studies. Off-campus programs  include the cooperative B.A.-B.S.E. Engineering Programs at Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Minnesota,  where students may earn a degree in engineering, the Oak Ridge Science  Semester, and the study of medicinal chemistry on an Interim abroad  program to Jamaica. Internships in local industrial settings are  another way to take college learning to another level. Consult the  Index for information on each of these programs. The Chemistry  Department participates in the Foreign Language Across the Curriculum  (FLAC) Program, which offers students the opportunity to use their  foreign language skills in selected courses. (See FOREIGN LANGUAGES  ACROSS THE CURRICULUM.) </p>
