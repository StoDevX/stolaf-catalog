            <p class="goldhead">REGISTRAR&rsquo;S OFFICE</p>
            <p class="body">The Registrar&rsquo;s Office is located on the main level of the Administration Building. Student hours are 8:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m., Monday-Friday except on &ldquo;deadline days&rdquo; (last day to add/drop or change a course grade designation) when the window is open 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. In the summer, the office closes daily at 4:30p.m. and is closed after 12 p.m. (noon) on Friday. </p>
            <p class="body">During the regular academic year, students may make appointments with staff members. Student inquiries relating to private/personal academic matters should be made in person, not by telephone. The Registrar&rsquo;s Office is closed during the daily chapel service. Forms and papers relating to adding and dropping courses, S/U changes, faculty advisers, academic programs, regulations, off-campus courses, transcripts, registrations, transfer work, petitions, and other daily matters are available at the registrar&rsquo;s window or on the registrar&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.%20stolaf.edu/offices/registrar%20">http://www. stolaf.edu/offices/registrar</a></p>
            <p class="body">The numbers of the office are: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body">(507) 646-3014<br>
                (507)
                  646-3015<br>
                 (507) 646-3210 fax<br>
                e-mail: <a href="mailto:registrar@stolaf.edu">registrar@stolaf.edu</a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="goldhead">REGISTRATION</p>
            <p class="body">Course credits cannot be earned unless a student is officially registered with the college for courses actu-ally taken. Registration for courses and sections is made only through the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. Informal arrangements, including section changes, between a student and an instructor do not constitute official registration. The presence of a student&rsquo;s name on a class list in Moodle (the college&rsquo;s course managment tool) does not constitute in and of itself official registration in the course. Registration does not go into effect until the student has made arrangements for financial charges with the Business Office. </p>
            <p>College-wide registrations are held three times each year: September (new students) for Fall Semester, November for Interim and Spring Semester, and April (currently enrolled students) for Fall Semester and Summer School. New students, students not enrolled during the previous semester, and students return-ing from off-campus programs may register in the opening days of each term. Specific registration dates are posted on the academic calendar. Note that students must have settled their tuition bills with the Busi-ness Office to be able to register for a term. </p>
            <p>Students must register in person or through a proxy at times appointed to each by the registrar. Appointments are rotated alphabetically from registration to registration so no one group of students is consistently first, last, or in the middle of the registration schedule. Special arrangements are made for dis-abled students. Failure to register at the appointed time may result in a limited selection of courses. Part-time students, high school honors students, and other &ldquo;special status&rdquo; students register on the first day after classes begin each term at the registrar&rsquo;s window. </p>
            <p>Students should consult the Registrar&rsquo;s Office web page to verify the courses for which they are regis-tered and to inspect their degree audits. Schedule errors and/or corrections to the record should be made at the registrar&rsquo;s window immediately. </p>
            <p class="subhead">1. Procedure:</p>
            <p class="body">Registration is made only on an official registration form sent to each student&rsquo;s faculty adviser approximately three weeks prior to registration. Advisers notify students or post appointment times for discussion and the transfer of the signed registration form to the student to bring to registration. </p>
            <p>Students going on off-campus programs must register for the program at registration. If the program includes an Interim, registration must be made at both the semester and the Interim registrations. </p>
            <p class="subhead">2. Changes in Registration:</p>
            <p class="body">Students may change their course registration up until the deadline on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar posted on the registrar&rsquo;s web page. Registration changes (adding or dropping courses, S/U changes, etc.) are processed with drop/add slips available from, and returnable to, the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. The date the signed slip is returned to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office, not the date it was signed, determines whether the change meets the deadline. An unreported drop or withdrawal results in an F in the course. Being on a closed-course waiting list does not negate the deadline for adding a course. </p>
            <p>If a student drops a performance studies course (lessons) after the fifth day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made. </p>
            <p>Students who wish to change their registration after deadlines may do so on a petition form that they pick up from and return to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. Such petitions, including assigning handling fees, are acted on by the registrar. The student may appeal a decision on a petition to the Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee, whose decisions are final. Students are notified of the decision by e-mail, usually the day the decision is made. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Class and Lab Schedules</p>
            <p class="body">The fully updated <em><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedule</a> </em>is posted and maintained on the Registrar&rsquo;s Office web page. The schedule list the titles and times of all courses offered during the next academic term. </p>
            <p>The schedule indicates amounts of credit and the requirements that a particular course fulfills. Should a schedule be found in error with regard to course credit, the registrar maintains a master course file for reference and inspection. </p>
            <p>Meeting places of all courses and dates for final exams are posted on the Registrar&rsquo;s Office website. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">DEADLINES</p>
            <p class="body">The registrar posts deadlines pertaining to courses and academic procedures on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. The policy governing these academic deadlines is set by the St. Olaf faculty upon recommendation of the Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="goldhead">ADDING COURSES</p>
            <p class="body">A student may add a course until the deadline specified on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar by submitting to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office an appropriately signed drop/add slip. No course addition will be permitted that creates an overload for the term. </p>
            <p>A student who has been placed on an instructor&rsquo;s waiting list, and who subsequently gains entry into a previously closed course, must officially add the course at the Registrar&rsquo;s Office by the posted add deadline. If a student adds a course which creates a course overload, he/she must drop a course to make room for the addition by the add deadline posted on the college calendar. </p>
            <p>Note that first-half and second-half semester courses have posted deadlines different from those for semester-length courses. Consult the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. </p>
            <p>Performance studies lessons can be added only with a music lesson drop/add slip available from the Music Office. This drop/add slip must be processed by the Music Department academic administrative assistant before it will be accepted at the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">DROPPING COURSES</p>
            <p class="body">With the exception of cases involving possible honor code violations (see below), a student may drop (withdraw from) any course for which he/she is registered until the deadline for dropping a course posted on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar<em>. </em></p>
            <p>A drop/add slip, which is available from and must be returned to the registrar&rsquo;s window, must be properly signed by the instructor whose course is being dropped. An unreported drop results in an F in the course. </p>
            <p>Note that first-half and second-half semester courses have deadlines different from those deadlines for courses that last the entire semester. </p>
            <p>If a student drops a performance studies course after the first day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made. </p>
            <p>A student must be registered for at least 3.00 credits in order to retain full-time status, and to receive veteran&rsquo;s benefits. Four full courses are required to maintain certain forms of State of Minnesota financial aid. Degree candidate students dropping below the three-full-course minimum during a semester may lose housing (residence hall) privileges and financial aid. Students who are considering dropping a course should consult with the Dean of Students Office before taking final action. </p>
            <p>Students dropping a Carleton College course for which they are registered should consult &ldquo;<a href="specialreg.html#carleton">Carleton Inter-Registration</a>&rdquo; in this catalog. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Honor Code/Plagiarism Exceptions</b><br>
              A student under review for an honor code violation may not drop the course in question unless a withdrawal is authorized by the student honor council. A student who is assessed a penalty of failure in a course as a result of an honor system violation or a plagiarism offense is not permitted to drop the course in question. </p>
            <p>For more information about the St. Olaf honor system and its procedures and about plagiarism, see <em>The Book, </em>available online at <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook">http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook</a><em>. </em>Questions about the honor system should be directed to the Office of the Dean of Students. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">LATE ADD (COURSES)</p>
            <p class="body">Deadlines for adding a course are designated on the registrar's calendar. Students who wish to add a course after the posted deadline may do so on a petition form that they pick up from and return in person to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office window. The petition form must be signed by the instructor of the added course, the instructor of the dropped course, the student, and, for first-year students for all terms, the student&rsquo;s adviser. The date the add slip or a subsequent petition is submitted to the registrar, rather than the date it was signed, determines if the request meets the deadline. </p>
            <p>A student who mistakenly attends a different section of a course from the section registered must petition for a change in registration. The instructor for both sections must verify the error. </p>
            <p>Being placed on a waiting list for entry into a closed course does not negate the need to register properly for the course before the deadline for adding a course. </p>
            <p>Note that petitioning to add a course late without previous attendance may make taking the course more difficult; the instructor, therefore, must verify that the student has sufficient time to make up the work missed. A student may not subsequently request an incomplete grade for a course added late because of insufficient time to complete the assigned work. </p>
            <p>Note that a handling fee will be assigned for accepted petitions. </p>
            <p>The registrar will deny any petition to add a course after the scheduled final exam period for that course. The student may appeal to the Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee by resubmitting the original petition to the registrar. Decisions of the committee are final. </p>
            <p>A petition to add a course is not entertained beyond one year following the end of the term in which a course was taken. (This practice is consistent with the statute of limitations on notification of a grade error; see <a href="counting-courses.html#changes">GRADE CHANGES</a>.) </p>
            <p class="goldhead">LATE DROP (COURSES)</p>
            <p class="body">Deadlines for dropping a course are designated on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. Students desiring to drop a course after the posted deadline may petition with a form that they pick up from and return in person to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office window. The petition form must be signed by the instructor of the added course, the instructor of the dropped course, the student, and, for first-year students for all terms, the student's adviser. The date the drop slip or a subsequent petition is submitted to the registrar, rather than the date it was signed, determines if the request meets the deadline. </p>
            <p>If a student is dropping a course he/she never attended, the instructor must verify the absence from the class. </p>
            <p>An unreported withdrawal results in an F in the course. If the petition is granted, a notation of WP or WF will be made on the student's transcript to indicate whether the student was doing passing or failing work at the time that the course was dropped. </p>
            <p>Note that a handling fee will be assigned for accepted petitions. </p>
            <p>The registrar will deny any petition to drop a course after the scheduled final exam period for that course. The student may appeal to the Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee by resubmitting the original petition to the registrar.&nbsp; Decisions of the committee are final. </p>
            <p>A petition to drop a course is not entertained beyond one year following the end of the term in which a course was taken. (This practice is consistent with the statute of limitations on notification of a grade error; see <a href="counting-courses.html#changes">GRADE CHANGES</a>.) </p>
            <p class="goldhead">REPEATING A COURSE</p>
            <p class="body">Most courses may be repeated only once, only at St. Olaf, and only when the grade is C- or below, U or N. A course cannot be repeated after satisfactory completion of any course in the same department or program for which the repeated course is considered a prerequisite. A repeated course may be taken S/U only if the course was originally taken S/U and a U was received. If a course receives an S credit, it may not be repeated regardless of the actual reported grade. A course may earn only one credit once completed with a passing grade of D- or higher. Each course attempt remains part of the permanent record, but only the second grade is computed into the grade point average. </p>
            <p>Students projecting grade point averages where the projection involves repeating a course should consult with the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. See individual department listings for policies relating to specific departments. </p>
            <p align="left">There are a few courses that are considered &ldquo;allowable repeats.&rdquo; Please see individual department course listing. If a course may be repeated, it will say so in the course description. An example is Music 345, Advanced Study in Music History. Such courses may be repeated if the topic is different each time. </p>
            <p>See also pages 22 and 240 regarding PHA courses and intercollegiate athletics. </p>
            <p class="goldhead"><a name="su"></a>S/U OPTION (SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY)</p>
            <p class="body">Students may take six of the 35 required full credits on an S/U basis. The intent of this option is to allow students to explore areas in which they have an interest, without the grade counting in their G.P.A.</p>
            <p>All courses are open to the S/U option as distinguished from P/N (pass/no pass) courses where the ungraded option is mandatory. Neither an S nor a U figure into the grade point average. An S is awarded for a grade of C- or higher; a U represents a grade of D+ or lower. A U does not earn course credit. </p>
            <p>Students should exercise caution in choosing to take courses on an S/U basis. Some graduate schools, for example, assume that a grade of S replaces a C or C-. </p>
            <p class="subhead">The S/U Provisions for All Students Are:</p>
            <p class="body">In completing the minimum of 35 full credits required for graduation, students may take up to six full course equivalents on an S/U basis. </p>
            <p>Of courses taken to meet general education requirements, only .25 credit courses may be taken on an S/U basis. Such courses are counted toward the six full credit course equivalents allowed. Full or .50 credit courses taken S/U do not fulfill general education requirements. </p>
            <p>A maximum of one full course equivalent taken S/U may count toward the minimum requirements for a major or an interdisciplinary concentration. Individual departments may have stricter rules. </p>
            <p>The 24-graded-course graduation requirement must be observed. </p>
            <p>Students may elect to change the grading option from graded to S/U or from S/U to graded through the deadlines designated at the Registrar&rsquo;s Office as posted on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. </p>
            <p>Courses taken S/U on St. Olaf off-campus programs count toward the six full-course equivalents allowed. This use of S/U is distinguished from off-campus courses offered P/N only. </p>
            <p>Students going on non-St. Olaf off-campus programs may be subject to a reduced number of S/U courses and should consult with the registrar in advance. </p>
            <p>Students transferring to St. Olaf, or transferring work taken at other institutions after entering St. Olaf, may be subject to additional S/U restrictions and should consult with the registrar in advance. </p>
            <p>A course completed on an S/U basis may not be assigned another type of grade at a later date. If a student receives an S credit in a course, that course may not be repeated regardless of the actual reported grade. </p>
            <p>No indication of S/U registration is made on a professor&rsquo;s class list. </p>
            <p>Some courses are offered on the P/N basis only upon previous approval of the dean of the college; announcement is made in the <em><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedule</a>. </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">S/U CHANGES </p>
            <p class="body">Deadlines for changing courses from S/U to graded or from graded to S/U are designated on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. Students wishing to make an S/U change after the posted deadline may petition to do so on a petition form that they pick up from and return in person to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office window. The petition form must be signed by the student and the student&rsquo;s adviser, but not by the course instructor. The date the S/U slip or a subsequent petition is submitted to the registrar, rather than the date it was signed, determines if the request meets the deadline. </p>
            <p>Note that a handling fee will be assigned for accepted petitions. </p>
            <p>A course completed on an S/U basis may not be assigned another type of grade at a later date. </p>
            <p>The registrar will deny any petition to change a course's grading option from graded to S/U after the scheduled final exam period for that course. The student may appeal to the Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee by resubmitting the original petition to the registrar. Decisions of the committee are final. </p>
            <p>A petition to make a graded to S/U change is not entertained beyond one year following the end of the term in which a course was taken. (This practice is consistent with the statute of limitations on noti-fication of a grade error; see <a href="counting-courses.html#changes">GRADE CHANGES</a>.) </p>
            <p class="goldhead">U GRADES</p>
            <p class="body">Under the S/U option, a U will be assigned for any grade of D+ or lower. A student earning a grade of D+ to F in a course taken S/U receives a U, which carries no credit. A U cannot be assigned another type of grade at a later date. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">CLOSED COURSES</p>
            <p class="body">At registration courses may be closed to additional enrollment by the department chair or interdisciplinary program director. Thereafter an instructor may add a student to a course by signing a drop/add slip returnable by the student to the registrar&rsquo;s window before the posted add deadline. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">PROXY REGISTRATION</p>
            <p class="body">Students away on St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus programs may have a resident student proxy register for them for the next term. Likewise, students unable to register at their scheduled registration time may have a proxy register for them for the next term. </p>
            <p>A proxy may not request another student&rsquo;s transcript or degree audit from the registrar. Rather the off-campus student should make arrangements to share academic and course information with his/her proxy. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">WAITING LISTS</p>
            <p class="body">A waiting list to enroll in a course closed at registration is an informal arrangement between a student and the instructor of the course. The arrangement does not negate the college-wide deadline for adding a course or the need to submit a signed drop/add slip. It does not constitute a promise on the part of the college that a closed course will be open at a later date. </p>
            <p>The registrar keeps a waiting list for each course during registration. The Registrar&rsquo;s Office turns over waiting lists to instructors at the end of each registration period. </p>
