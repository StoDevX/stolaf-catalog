              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong> Thomas Bredeson (Economics), finance, investments; Mary Ann Emery (Economics), financial accounting, intermediate accounting, personal finance;  James Mader (Economics), financial accounting; Sian Muir (Economics), entrepreneurship, management strategy, marketing, arts management; John Ophaug (Economics), Business Law</span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Management  studies is a multidisciplinary program offering a contract  concentration in management studies that can be earned in conjunction  with any B.A. academic major. Individual  contracting encourages students to consider personal goals as they  design a program of courses in management studies, economics, and other  disciplines. The Management Studies Program also supports the  management and finance areas of emphasis within the economics major  (see Department of Economics). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> To meet the challenges of an ever-changing world, graduates must be ready to take advantage of opportunities and create their own success. A St. Olaf liberal arts education encourages students to view the world from multiple perspectives, build fundamental communication and problem-solving skills, wrestle with questions of ethics, and develop a global perspective. The management studies concentration connects theory and practice and helps students make the transition from college to career. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  management studies concentration prepares students for careers in  domestic and international business, not-for-profit and governmental  organizations, and entrepreneurial ventures. Students direct their  efforts by choosing elective courses and experiences that focus on a  special area of interest. For example: a student who hopes to start a  business can elect to take Management Studies 256 (Entrepreneurship) and  apply for a Finstad grant to pursue a business idea. (See information  about the Finstad Program for Entrepreneurial Studies below.) </p>
