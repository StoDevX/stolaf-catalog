              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong>  Christopher Chiappari, religion, identity, social change and development, immigration, Latin America; Michael R. Leming, religion, death, family, Thailand and Southeast Asia; Bruce Nordstrom-Loeb, gender, family, race and class; Samiha Sidhom Peterson, development sociology, family, gender, education, global interdependence, Arab world; Ryan Sheppard, family, gender, race/ethnicity, social movements, quantitative research; Thomas Williamson, nationalism, health, globalization, cultural theory, Southeast Asia </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Sociology  and anthropology share the belief that society and culture shape us in  powerful ways and that we can only know ourselves when we understand  our social and cultural context. Our personalities and choices reflect  who we are, but so do the groups and social institutions to which we  belong (peers, family, religion, politics, occupations). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  grew out of efforts to understand the nature and problems of modern  industrial societies, while anthropology grew out of European &amp; American (colonial) encounters with diverse world cultures. Both seek to explain the  relationships among individuals, groups, institutions, culture, and  meaning; both seek insights into the pressing personal and social  issues of our day. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  and anthropology contribute to current debates in politics, philosophy,  theology, and other areas about multiculturalism, environment, gender,  inequality, &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; development, welfare reform, globalization,  and immigration. All require clear understanding of life&rsquo;s social and cultural dimensions. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Occupations  drawing on sociological and anthropological knowledge include policy  research and planning, human resources and industrial relations, public  and international relations, law, medicine, ministry, counseling,  education, management, social work, and marketing. Both disciplines  also help prepare students for social service and justice work. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">The  major in sociology/anthropology requires completion of at least nine  courses distributed as follows: five core courses  (Sociology/Anthropology 291, 292, 371, 373, 399) and four elective  courses, including at least one course from the area and topical groups  (230s, 240s) and one from the social structures and processes group  (260s).Transfer students are under the same requirements as students in  their graduating class. Majors are also required to take Statistics 110  (offered by the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science  Department). Statistics 110 is best taken before   Sociology/Anthropology 371. Students are permitted to take one of the four elective courses, but not a core course, S/U. An introductory course is not required but may be used as an elective for the major. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Students  who study abroad on a St. Olaf program that includes a sociology or  anthropology course may petition to have this course count toward their  major. One independent study/research course or an off-campus field  internship supervised by department faculty may also count toward the  major. </p>

              <p class="goldsubhead"> level I COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-115"></a>115 The Anthropology of War and Peace</p>
<p>This course approaches longstanding questions about the meaning of conflict, violence, and
power in human societies from an anthropological perspective.  The course examines
indigenous traditions of conflict and conviviality and the violence indigenous societies
endured in colonial encounters with the West.  Students also consider anthropological
approaches to modern forms of violence including terrorism, ethnic cleansing, and state
violence.  Finally, students examine anthropological approaches to the analysis of twenty-first
century wars and contemporary peace movements.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-116"></a>116 Modern Elixirs: The Anthropology of Mood-Altering Substances</p>
<p>In many respects, products like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and opium provide the glue that holds
together modern life. This course examines the web of these substances from an anthropological
perspective. Our focus includes the politics of production, the culturally diverse practices of
consumption, and the social consequences of regulation. Based on our collective experience at
St. Olaf, we consider the mood-altering substances on and off campus and examine their influence
in such things as our social identity, individual consciousness and the structure of authority.
Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-120"></a>120 Anthropology of Jazz</p>
<p>In this course we will explore how jazz music and accompanying cultural forms have reflected as
well as shaped American society and culture. Utilizing photographs, film, music and texts, we will
examine how race, class, and gender structured jazz, as well as politics, urbanization, migration,
and technology. We will look at jazz in terms of social deviance and as a social movement,
including its relationship to slavery, segregation and African cultural roots.  Offered during
Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-121"></a>121 Introduction to Sociology</p>
<p>This course helps students explore the connections between society and their own lives.  Students
answer challenging questions such as "Do we have a 'human nature'?," "Why does social inequality
exist?," "What is race?," and "How do societies change?" In answering these questions students
learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing so they review the various research methods
and theories that form the sociological tradition.  This course is primarily open to first year
students or students in certain accredited programs.  Offered both semesters.  Open to first-year
students only.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-128"></a>128 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology</p>
<p>How do anthropologists study other cultures? Peoples around the world create different realities
through the ways they conceptualize experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do
what they need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe and compare cultures and societies,
focusing on different aspects such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion and
values, economy and technology, cultural and social change.  This course is primarily open to first
year students or students in certain accredited programs.  Offered both semesters.  Open to
first-year students only.</p>

 <p class="goldsubhead"> AREA COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-232"></a>232 Thailand: Culture, Institutions, and Interactions</p>
<p>This course offers a sociological understanding of Thailand, focusing on Thai culture and the
institutions of education, religion, and economy, drawing partly on guest lecturers and visits to
Thai sites.  It also provides beginning skills and experience in ethnography - social scientific
observation and interpretation of interactions in "the field" - for example, among Thai students,
monks, and vendors and customers in markets.  Offered during Interim.</p>

              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-234"></a>234 Native North American Cultures and Religions</p>
<p>As an overview of the variety of belief systems and ways of life, this course explores ethnographic
case studies of Native American groups from the major culture areas of North America north of
Mexico.  Topics addressed in this course include language families, social organization systems,
ecological and economic adaptations, material culture, religions, and revitalization movements.
This course will also examine the impacts of colonial encounters upon Native American cultures.
Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-236"></a>236 The Arab World</p>
<p>Focusing on present day Arab and Middle Eastern countries, the course explores the role of the
institutions of family and religion in maintaining continuity, while also identifying sources of
change such as the colonial experience, regional and global interdependence, the social impact of
oil, fundamentalist movements, and the co-existence of traditional and "modern" values.  Offered
Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-237"></a>237 Forging a Latin American Culture</p>
<p>This course explores the forces that shape contemporary Latin America society, including material
and cultural interactions with Europe, Africa, and the U.S. Emphasis is placed on understanding the
formation of the region in terms of the responses of key groups of actors (indigenous peoples,
women, peasants, workers, the poor, revolutionaries) to the actions of outside and/or more powerful
forces and institutions (conquerors, the state, the military, missionaries, multinational
corporations).  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-239"></a>239 Modern Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is a diverse region, stretching from the sleek high-rises of Singapore to hermetic
Rangoon; from Islam to Buddhism; from computer chip manufacture to swidden agriculture.  Students
read ethnographies, novels, and local histories to better understand Southeast Asian family life,
religion, language, and education. Through focusing on the experience of modernity, students
examine how Southeast Asians make sense of their group affiliations, their pasts and their futures.
The course aims to challenge contemporary understandings of place, entitlement, and home both
in Southeast Asia and beyond.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="goldsubhead"> TOPICAL COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-242"></a>242 Contemporary Native American Issues</p>
<p>What do self-determination and cultural identity mean for Native American peoples today?  Students
examine the impact of colonization on Native American peoples, including federal policies, treaty
rights, and sovereignty. Issues include economy and politics on reservations, family and gender
roles, orality and literacy, persistence and revitalization of religious life and culture, urban
life, and recent social movements and organizations.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-244"></a>244 Gender Matters at Work</p>
<p>Students gain a sociological understanding of gender and work which they can use to understand
the larger work world and their own lives and careers.   The course explores gender and work in
terms of history, current conditions, causes, consequences, and sources of transformation, largely
in the United States but also globally.  Topics range across domestic labor, unequal pay and
promotion, sexual harrassment, survival jobs such as garment assembly, laws, workplace
policies, and union organizing.  Offered during Interim.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-246"></a>246 GLBT Lives and Issues</p>
<p>This course explores the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people from several
social science perspectives.  We'll look at whether gender and sexual orientation (both
heterosexual and homosexual) are socially constructed or biologically natural, and what
cross-cultural and historical examples can tell us.  We'll look at controversies over the family and
religious status of GLBT people, why homosexuality has become such a political issue, and movements
for change.  Offered during Interim.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-248"></a>248 Sociology of Dying, Death and Bereavement</p>
<p>This class investigates death-related behavior from an American and cross-cultural structural
perspective, seeking to understand patterns of social interaction surrounding and giving meaning to
dying, death, and bereavement. Topics include: death meanings and anxiety, religion and
death-related customs, the dying process, hospice as a social movement, biomedical issues, the
funeral industry, death rituals, and the social understanding of the bereavement process.  Offered
Fall Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-249"></a>249 Indigenous Peoples</p>
<p>Hunters and gatherers, herders and agriculturalists who have developed successful strategies for
utilizing natural resources while maintaining ecological balance are in danger of losing their ways
of life. Deforestation, dams, pollution, global warming, desert expansion, and population
pressure -- the products of globalization and economic development -- are threatening the loss of
invaluable cultural knowledge as well as sustainable adaptations.  Students explore humans and the
environment and the survival of indigenous peoples. Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="goldsubhead"> SOCIAL structures and processes COURSES </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-260"></a>260 Marriage and the Family</p>
<p>This course provides a social science understanding of the "contemporary American family" and
analysis of marriage and family issues from a cross-cultural perspective.  Students discuss issues
of dating and mate selection, marital and parent-child relationships over the family life cycle,
gender issues, work and family roles, and problem-related issues affecting families (divorce,
violence and death) caused by rapid changes in society.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-261"></a>261 Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective</p>
<p>This course compares gender patterns and issues in various cultures around the world, such as
Latin America, the Middle East, India, the U.S., and East Asia. How do cultural expectations for
women and men vary? Why do some societies have more gender equality than others? How do
economic and political change, including globalization, impact gender roles? How do U.S. and Third
World feminism compare?  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-262"></a>262 Global Interdependence</p>
<p>Approaching the world as a "global village," the course will focus on the development of the world
as an interdependent entity, the relationship between the "developed" and "developing" world,
alternative explanations for planned social change, and new institutions for this international
world.  Global challenges such as the information revolution, population, the status of women, and
migration are analyzed to illustrate this interdependence.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-263"></a>263 Social Movements</p>
<p>Students explore social, political, and religious movements, focusing on case studies of struggles
utilizing both violent and nonviolent tactics. The course emphasizes the historical and cultural
contexts of social movements, including tradition, ritual and symbolism, colonialism, national
borders, and indigenous peoples. The role of cultural identities in the creation of communities of
resistance and movements for social change is also a central issue.  Offered Fall or Spring
Semester.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-264"></a>264 Race and Class in American Culture</p>
<p>Students explore the continuing significance of color, class, and immigration in the U.S., with a
focus on the experiences and concerns of African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics/Latinos,
and Asian-Americans. The course examines the nature and functions of prejudice; the relationship
among race, class and gender; the persistence of racism and inequality; and social policies and
social movements intended to create greater social justice.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-265"></a>265 Religion, Culture and Society</p>
<p>This course examines and analyzes religious beliefs, meanings, rituals, and organizational
patterns from an empirical perspective. Students study the social organization and functions of
religion, the process of secularization in society, the practice and function of civil religion,
religious conversion and defection, and sectarian religious movements.  Offered Fall or Spring
Semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-267"></a>267 Medical Anthropology</p>
<p>How do people understand illness and healing?  How does social inequality shape our health?  These
are among the questions explored by medical anthropology.  In this course we will examine the ways
people in different societies experience their bodies, by looking at AIDS in Haiti, old age in
India, and childbirth in the United States.  We will investigate diverse understandings of health,
different means of promoting healing, and the role of power in providing medical care.
Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course.  Offered Fall or Spring Semester.</p>

 <p class="goldsubhead"> CORE COURSES/ INDEPENDENT STUDY/ INTERNSHIPS </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="sociology-291"></a>291 History of Sociological Theory</p>
<p>This course provides an overview of the major thinkers who sought to create a science of human
society, the ideas they found fundamental to a science of society and how human society changes

<p>This course introduces students to anthropological theory and the "culture" of the discipline
itself.  Students examine anthropology's formation during the Industrial Revolution and the Age
of Empire, which called for new explanations of human differences and gave new significance to
the nature and meaning of "culture."  They explore the method of participant observation research,
the question of whether anthropology is a science, the problem of representing one culture to
another, and the changing nature of ethnographic writing.  Open to Sociology/Anthropology majors
only.  Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course.  Offered Fall Semester.</p>
