                <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong> Gwendolyn Barnes-Karol (Romance Languages), Hispanic culture and literature; Maggie Broner (Romance Languages), Hispanic culture and literature; Christopher Chiappari (Sociology/ Anthropology), anthropology of religion, Guatemala; Jeane DeLaney (History), Latin American history-past and present; Le&oacute;n Narv&aacute;ez (Romance Languages), Hispanic culture and literature, migration studies; Bruce Nordstrom-Loeb (Sociology/Anthropology), sociology/anthropology; Nancy Paddleford (Music), Latin American/Spanish music; David Schodt (Economics), economic development, Ecuador; Kathleen Shea (Biology), tropical biology; Ariel Strichartz (Romance Languages), Hispanic literature and culture; Kristina Thalhammer (Political Science), comparative politics, human rights </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Hispanic Studies offers an interdisciplinary structure for the systematic study of Latin America,  Spain, and U.S. Latinos, with distinct geography and cultures   unified by elements of a common heritage. Profound geographic  variations, differing economic resources, and the interactions of  Hispanic and indigenous cultures have yielded complex and diverse  Spanish-speaking societies. Increasing socioeconomic contacts between  states and societies in the Americas and the growing presence of  Latinos in United States underscore the need for U.S. citizens to deepen  their understanding of the region. The St. Olaf Hispanic Studies program offers courses, and a major and a concentration with an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approach that contribute to the investigation of political, economic, ethnic, gender, religious, and cultural issues of the Spanish-speaking world. The support of perspectives and methodologies of several disciplines inspires students to seek a deeper understanding of the Spanish speaking world. In addition, students find opportunities for reflecting on their own culture and society. </p>

                <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
                <p> <span class="body">The  requirements for the completion of a Hispanic Studies major consist of  eight courses: Spanish 270 or 271; Spanish 272, 273, or 274 (or a  substitute course approved by the director of Hispanic Studies); the interdisciplinary seminar, Hispanic Studies 333, <em>Contemporary Issues in Latin America,</em> and five approved courses dealing with Latin America,  Spain, or U.S. Latinos. These courses may be chosen from among history,  economics, anthropology, sociology, political science, religion, and art, with no more than two courses in any one discipline. </span></p>
                <p class="body"> Students  may count one Independent Research study towards the major, and they  may also count up to three study-abroad courses taken in Latin America  or Spain. With the approval of the Hispanic Studies director, students may have any course with substantial Hispanic content counted toward their major.</p>
                <p class="body">Students should contact the Hispanic Studies director as early as possible to plan a major. </p>
                <div>
                  <h6 class="body"><strong> Requirements for the Latin American/ Latino Studies Concentration </strong></h6>
                  <p class="body"> Students  majoring in any discipline except Hispanic Studies who have an interest in Latin America and  U.S. Latinos can pursue a Latin American/Latino Studies  concentration, which enables them to enhance their understanding of   Latin American countries and peoples, U.S. Latinos, and the  interconnectedness of Latin America and the United States. Topics  explored might include: the nature of social and political change,  economic development, social mobility and discrimination, the role of  women in society, the changing nature of Hispanic life, patterns of  migration, and adaptation and challenges to cultural and artistic  traditions. </p>
                  <p class="body"> The Latin American/Latino Studies Concentration is an individual verbal contract negotiated  between the student and the Hispanic Studies director. (Hispanic Studies majors may not obtain a concentration in Latin American/ Latino  Studies).</p>
                  <p class="body"> The requirements for the completion of the Latin American/Latino Studies Concentration consist of a  minimum of five approved courses,  subject to the following requirements: One of the courses  must be the interdisciplinary seminar, Hispanic Studies 333, <em>Contemporary Issues in Latin America</em>. A maximum of two courses in a given discipline may be counted. A maximum of two courses from off-campus programs may be counted. Either  Sociology 264 or ARMS 121 may be included in the concentration, but not  both. In addition, an interdisciplinary paper* focusing on a theme related to the  concentration must be written for one of the courses offered for the  concentration. This paper will be developed in consultation with  faculty advisors from two different disciplines. Students must contact the Hispanic Studies director as soon as possible to discuss this requirement.</p>

                <p class="body"> This seminar focuses on the implications of studying Latin America, or the way in which different conceptualizations of this region have helped to shape Latin America as an object of study. Possible topics for approaching this question include the history of Latin American studies in the United States and the relation between scholarship on Latin America and U.S. policy in the region; Latin American responses to U.S. representations of the region; the production of images of &quot;lo indigena&quot; according to Western expectations; and indigenous cultures and globalization.
