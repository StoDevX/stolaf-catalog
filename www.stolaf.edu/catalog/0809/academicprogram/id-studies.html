            <h2 class="programname"> Interdisciplinary Studies
            </h2>
            <p class="faculty"> <strong>Director, 2008-09:</strong> Phyllis Larson (Asian Studies), associate dean, Interdisciplinary and General Studies </p>
        <p class="programdescription"> Interdisciplinary  courses use the resources of several disciplines to investigate topics  that cut across departmental lines. These courses  raise awareness about the distinctive  methodologies and conceptual frameworks of different disciplines and  their strengths and possible biases in describing, explaining, and  evaluating reality. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="id-225"></a>225 From Certainty to Novelty: The Classical, the Quantum, and Beyond</p>
<p>This course explores the fundamental transformation in our conception of the physical world
since the sixteenth century.  The classical view suggests our universe is a grand machine
determined by universal laws and causal regularities.  The quantum revolution of the early twentieth
century, and its extensions into our own time, have emphasized indeterminacy, entanglement,
complexity, and emergent novelty.  This revolution in thought will be investigated from scientific,
philosophical, and theological perspectives.  Team taught.  Offered Fall semester.</p>

              <p class="coursename"><a name="id-230"></a>230  Communicating Science and Mathematics (.25 Credit)</p>
<p>Oral communication is an essential part of science and mathematics. Students work closely
with a faculty member to learn and practice important aspects of communicating technical
information to both expert and non-expert audiences. Enrollment by permission of instructor
only. Prerequisite: Previous participation in summer communication series.  P/N only.  Offered both
semesters.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-234"></a>234 Human Geography of the Middle East</p>
<p>This course provides an examination and application of the key content, skills, and perspectives
of human geography.  The lens of the geographer focuses on the spatial distribution of
phenomena over the surface of the earth, asking the questions "where" and "why there."  The
practices and skills of geography are used to investigate a variety of issues in the Middle East,
including environmental problems, the culture and management of sacred places, and the
reasons for war and the need for peace.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-236"></a>236 Research Strategies Across the Disciplines</p>
<p>This course familiarizes students with research strategies in their respective disciplines and
prepares them to successfully complete their faculty-led research projects through the TRiO
McNair program.  Students read research articles written by their faculty mentor, complete a
literature search, and design a poster for a research symposium.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-238"></a>238 War and Peace</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary approach to war and peace, this course incorporates the dual perspective
of philosophy and history. Students study various ethical arguments as shaped in different
cultures.  Examples are drawn from ancient Athens, medieval Christendom, Asia, Islam, and the
modern West; ethical topics include: pacifism, utilitarianism, divine command ethics, natural law
theory, feminism, and cultural relativism. The course begins with warfare as treated in the Bible
and concludes with nuclear terrorism.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-249"></a>249 Mare Balticum (abroad)</p>
<p>Starting with Hanseatic and Teutonic traditions of entrepreneurship from the 13th-century, this
course focuses on the political and economic history of a region that has transitioned from
tribalism to feudalism, the to mercantilism, capitalism, communism, and now EU-type capitalism.  The
course develops in an itinerant way -- city to city -- starting in Lübeck, Germany, then proceeding
eastward to the cities of Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wolgast, Szczecin, Koszalin,
Danzig, Malbork, Ketrzyn, Vilnius, Kaunas, the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg
in Germany's East Prussia), Klaipeda, Riga, Tartu, Tallinn, crossing by ship to Helsinki, Finland,
and again by ship to Stockholm, Sweden.  Students will deliver many oral presentations, including a
group project of a business plan for a hypothetical start -up.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-255"></a>255 The Physician in Clinical and Hospital Health Care</p>
<p>Students will explore health care in a clinical and hospital setting through association with a
physician in one of the clinics that are a part of the metro area Fairview Health System or the
Family Practice Medical Center of Willmar, Minnesota.  Students will follow the physician, who
serves as their primary mentor, or other designated physicians through their daily activities in
pertinent clinical and hospital settings.  Students will observe the delivery of health care in
primary and specialty areas and in practices dealing with all age groups.  Emergency health care and
physician support areas are other aspects of medicine to which students will be exposed.  Students
will keep a journal detailing their observations and their interpretation of and reaction to these
observations and will write a research paper on an aspect of current medical care and practice.
Selection is based on a review of all applicants (preference given to junior or senior pre-medical
students with demonstrated strong academic achievement).  P/N grading.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="id-258"></a>258 Theater in London (abroad)</p>
<p>A full immersion in the art of theater, students will attend approximately 22 performances at London
and Stratford theaters.  The course will include the reading of play texts, dramatic criticism,
group discussions and backstage tours.  England, a theatrical center of the English-speaking world,
enables students to experience a wide variety of theatrical performances ranging from traditional to
modern.  Excursions to Stratford-upon-Avon, Stonehenge, Canterbury and Oxford offer additional
cultural perspectives.</p>

<p class="coursename">294 Internship</p>
<p class="coursename">298 Independent Study</p>
<p class="coursename">394 Internship</p>

background material, technical instruction, identification of a meaningful project, and data
collection.  The topic is determined by the faculty member in charge of the course and may
relate to his/her research interests.  Prerequisite: Determined by individual instructor.  Offer
