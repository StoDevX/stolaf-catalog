              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2008-09:</strong> Mary Steen, writing </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong>  Mark Allister, American literature, environmental literature, American studies;  Richard C. Buckstead, American literature, Asian literature; Karen Cherewatuk, Anglo Saxon, medieval literature; Jennifer Kwon Dobbs, creative writing; Jenny Dunning, creative writing; Richard DuRocher, Renaissance literature, Milton;  Joan Hepburn, African American literature, drama;  Jan C.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Literature  is one of the most compelling ways in which humans have recorded and  reflected on their lives, imagined different worlds, and communicated  one with another. Literature offers the pleasures of artistic  expression combined with the powerful consolations of empathy and  insight, knowledge and inspiration. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  English Department offers a major that, drawing on some 1,500 years of  literatures in English, provides a sound foundation in the history of  British and American literature and introduces students to the more  recent, global range of literatures in English. It contrasts and  connects literatures in English across national boundaries, historical  periods, differing cultures, and the various literary genres. Students read from Geoffrey Chaucer to Chinua Achebe, from Mary  Rowlandson to Jamaica Kincaid; they read epics, novels, and plays,  essays and memoirs, lyrics and short stories. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In discussing and writing on what they have read, students develop an informed understanding  of the force of literary language and improve their own powers of  communication, analysis, and persuasion. In the department&rsquo;s creative  writing courses, students can nourish their own verbal creativity and, perhaps, make their own contribution to literatures in English. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  English major is easily and frequently combined with other majors.  English courses also count toward general education requirements (see  below) and contribute to a number of interdisciplinary concentrations,  including American racial and multicultural studies, American  studies, medieval studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. The English major is  very compatible with off-campus and overseas study (see below under  Special Programs), since most courses taken elsewhere in literature in  English can count toward the major as electives. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> What can you do with an English major? Students who wish to teach English at the secondary  school level use their major towards a Communication Arts and  Literature License. Most English majors use their powers of critical  thinking, verbal comprehension, reading, writing, and speaking to enter  a wide range of jobs, occupations, training programs, and professions. They find that what their English major gave them is good for the marketplace and good for a lifetime. </p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  basic English major is nine courses. All majors complete the same four  courses: English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a category  designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo; (GLE). With  the remaining five (or more) electives, two of which must be at Level  III, students can pursue their own particular interests and give their  major the emphasis they choose, whether particular authors, historical periods, genres or topics, or a focus on creative writing. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
              <p class="body"> Many English courses carry general education credit in ALS-L, ORC and WRI. Some carry HWC, MCS-G and MCS-D,  and EIN credit. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> PREREQUISITES </h5>
              <p class="body"> General  Education 111 or its equivalent is a prerequisite for all other courses  in the department except some Level I Interim  courses. While a few courses have additional prerequisites, most Level  I and Level II courses are open to all &mdash; majors and non-majors alike &mdash;  after General Education  111. Level III courses (numbered 300 or higher) are primarily for  English majors and ordinarily build upon prior work. All Level III  courses require as a prerequisite English 185 and at least one Level II  course in an area of relevant background as confirmed by the instructor  or the department. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> <span class="body">Requirements for the Graduation Major </span></h6>
                <p class="body"> Nine  English courses including English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a  category designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo; (GLE); plus five electives (two of which must be at Level III).  Supplementary courses in disciplines such as classics, history,  philosophy, and modern foreign languages are recommended for all majors. </p>
                <p class="body"> GLE  courses are offered at both Level II and III and may be taken at any  time during the major. Courses in this category are global in scope  (that is, not confined to, although they may include, literature  written in Great Britain and the USA). GLE courses emphasize the  multicultural, transnational, and post-colonial  nature of much literature written in English. A list of courses meeting  this requirement will be posted on the department website each term. </p>
                <p class="body"><strong> Requirements for the Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure plus English Graduation Major </strong></p>
                <p class="body"> Eight  English courses including English 185, 221, 222, and one course from a  category designated &ldquo;Global Literatures in English, 1850-Present&rdquo; (GLE); 233; 251 or 257; 274; and one Level III literature elective;  Theatre 100, 120; Media Studies 160; plus the requirements in  professional education, including Education 321 and 345.

                <p class="body"><strong> Requirements for the Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure </strong></p>
                <p class="body"> Six  English courses including English 185; 221; 233; 251 or 257; 274; and one English  literature elective; two of Theatre 100, 115, 120, 130; Media Studies  160; plus the requirements in professional education, including Education 321 and 345. (Consult the CAL Licensure Advisor.) </p>
              </div>
            </div>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  English Department awards distinction on the basis of a student&rsquo;s  overall record in the department and on the quality of a written  project &ndash; critical or creative &ndash; submitted by the candidate in his or  her senior  year. To be a candidate for departmental distinction, a student must  have completed a minimum of seven graded  courses in the major, six of which must have been taught by St. Olaf College faculty. The combined GPA of all graded courses in the major taught by St. Olaf faculty must be 3.5 or higher. Such students may apply at the  beginning of either the Fall Semester or the Spring Semester of their  senior year. Students interested in distinction should obtain  guidelines from the Department Distinction Coordinator and find a  supervisor in the English Department before applying. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p class="body"> Special  programs include semester and full-year study in England at Oxford,  Lancaster, and East Anglia; study in Scotland at Aberdeen; semester and  full-year study in Ireland at Trinity College, University College  Dublin and University College Galway; Interim study in the Caribbean  and in Ireland; semester and Interim study at the Newberry Library in  Chicago; Urban Teaching semester in Chicago; Interim theater study in  London; internships in writing.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY </h5>
              <p class="body"> Students  planning on graduate study in English should take the graduation major  and additional courses for a total not to exceed 14. Specific programs  should be planned with the student&rsquo;s academic advisor. At least two  foreign languages should be included, one of which should be French or  German. In recent years, English majors have been accepted for graduate  study in literature (at Berkeley, Chicago, Princeton, Toronto,  Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin) and in writing (at Boston  University, George Mason, Iowa, and New School University). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Level  II courses (numbered in the 200s) are open to all students without  prerequisite beyond General Education 111 or its equivalent. Level III  courses (numbered in the 300s) are primarily confined to the major,  demand control of methods and of basic factual and theoretical  knowledge appropriate to English studies, require more advanced work,  assume more preparation, and pursue subjects in greater depth than do  Level II courses. Level III courses are open to students with the  stated prerequisites. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Courses  in writing provide the opportunity for students, whether beginning or  experienced writers, to develop their own work in a variety of modes  including poetry, journalism, creative nonfiction, drama, and fiction  for both beginning and experienced writers. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> LITERARY STUDIES </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="english-108"></a>108 The Hero and the Trickster in Post-Colonial Literature</p>
<p>Students examine various heroic and trickster figures as manifested in post-colonial
literature from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, both oral and written, and seek to understand
what basic human needs and realities these figures express and fulfill.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-123"></a>123 Introduction to Poetry</p>
<p>This course introduces students to poetry from a range of perspectives including, but not
limited to: the poet's life; the application of categories of analysis such as race, gender, and
nationality; poetry as literary craft; and the aesthetic appreciation of poems.  To experience the
literary medium of poetry in the fullest sense, students are required to write about, memorize,
orally interpret/recite, and compose their own poetry.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-124"></a>124 Introduction to Drama</p>
<p>This course introduces students to literary analysis through dramatic texts and performance.
Activities may include trips to see local productions, student in-class performances, staged
readings, and viewing filmed productions.  Plays are drawn from varied genres, two or more
historical periods, and both traditional and experimental approaches.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-138"></a>138 Romantic Comedy and Film Noir</p>
<p>The course explores illuminating contrasts in these distinctively American film narratives, tracing
the origins and development of the two genres.  Attention will be given as well to the formal
features of cinematic storytelling --e.g. shots, composition, lighting, editing.  Exemplary films
range from "It Happened One Night" to "When Harry Met Sally," "Double Indemnity" to "Memento."
Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-169"></a>169 Detective Fiction</p>
<p>Students read detective stories from their earliest forms in Poe and Doyle to their postmodern
deconstruction in the hands of Paul Auster, and examine the problematic character of evidence,
causality, verification, agency, and meaning itself. These matters are understood differently in
different times and different places. Thus, a good detective story is also an investigation into
culture, race, and gender. Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-182"></a>182 The American Dramatic Tradition: Odets to Mamet</p>
<p>Students read and consider the American dramatic tradition from O'Neill and Odets to Baraka and
Shange and up to the present.  Particular emphasis is given to drama, both representational and
non-representational, of social commentary and protest.  Examination of the literature is
supplemented by filmic interpretations where applicable.  The course is appropriate for
non-majors with broad interests.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-185"></a>185 Literary Studies</p>
<p>As they read a variety of mostly contemporary literature from English-speaking countries around
the world, students learn strategies of critical analysis and interpretation.  They also practice
and develop skills in writing and oral communication.  This course is required of those beginning
the English major.  It is not recommended for general education students.  Prerequisite: FYW or
equivalent.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-200"></a>200 Reading and Writing the Personal Essay</p>
<p>The personal essay may contain rumination, memoir, anecdote, diatribe, scholarship, fantasy, and
moral philosophy. Students read and write about the personal essay from its origins to the present
day as well as craft their own personal essays. Readings range from founding father Montaigne
to classic practitioners Charles Lamb and Virginia Woolf; students also explore International
essayists such as Wole Soyinka and American voices from Thoreau to Annie Dillard.  Offered
during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-203"></a>203 Folklore</p>
<p>This course focuses on verbal folklore: narratives, songs, and shorter forms such as proverbs.  It
explores their intrinsic qualities as literary creations and also the ways in which they
operate together in combination or in dialogue. The folktale and the epic, for example,
incorporate a variety of these forms, such as the proverb, the song, or the riddle, to form a
complex whole.  Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-209"></a>209 Colonialism and the Novel</p>
<p>The history of British colonization of America, Africa, Asia, and Australia coincides with the
history of the novel's emergence as the major literary genre in English. This course examines
this parallel history by considering the ways in which the colonial experience has been
represented in novels from the 18th century to the present.  We will read six novels, tracing this
development in America, Africa, and Asia, and discuss the novels both in relationship to the
development of the novel in general, and to their place in colonial or postcolonial history.
Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-215"></a>215 Fiction Down Under</p>
<p>Students read novels and short stories by twenty to thirty Australian and New Nealand authors,
including Keri Hulme, Janet Frame, Frank Sargeson, Patricia Grace, Henry Lawson, David
Malouf, Richard Flanagan, and Kim Scott.  They encounter distinctive voices and strategies and
discuss issues of cultural identity, natural environment, indigenous peoples, and gender.
Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-221"></a>221 Literatures in English to 1650</p>
<p>Students explore poetry and prose from the earliest periods in the development of the English
language and literature -- by Caedmon, the Beowulf poet, Chaucer, Julian of Norwich, Malory,
Spenser, Shakespeare, Lady Mary Wroth, Donne, Milton -- and investigate how literary
conventions and social history interact. From sermons to sonnets, students examine 1000 years
of literary history and ultimately follow the voyage of English from Britain to the Americas.
Prerequisite: Prior or simultaneous study in English 185.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-222"></a>222 Literatures in English 1650 to 1850</p>
<p>Students study literary developments from the mid-17th to the mid-19th centuries. Topics
examined include the influence of the Puritan Revolution on literature; satiric modes
practiced by Dryden, Pope and Swift; the rise of the novel; the Romantic movement;
Transcendentalism; and the development of American identity as seen in writers such as
Franklin, Fuller, and Douglass. Prerequisite: English 221.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-227"></a>227 King Arthur Through the Ages</p>
<p>A study of the Arthurian legend, from its Celtic origins through the classic medieval romances of
Chrétien and Malory, to the Victorian adaptations of Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaëlites, to
contemporary novels and film.  The course focuses on the myth's characteristic forms and ideas:
the errant knight's adventures, the grail quest, and triangulating desire and adulterous love.
Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-230"></a>230 Literary Eras: British</p>
<p>These courses treat specific periods in British literature and examine the relationship between
literary texts and movements and their particular cultural, political, and historical contexts. Each
offering of this course examines a different literary era and emphasizes specific literary and
historical issues. Students may register for the course more than once provided a different era is
studied.  Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent.</p>
<p><B>The Middle Ages</B> focuses upon Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature, including the
Beowulf poet, Chaucer, Julian of Norwich, and Malory, in the context of emerging ideas such as
heroism, the role of women, and the relationship between secular society and the Church.</p>
<p><B>The Renaissance</B> examines radical literary changes in English literature, as they occur in
Spenser, Shakespeare, Lanyer, Donne, and Milton, in such contexts as the Protestant Reformation and
strife over Puritanism, court politics under Elizabeth and James, and the English Civil War.</p>
<p><B>The Age of Enlightenment</B> focuses upon neoclassical poetry and satire and the emergence of
the novel.  Writers such as Dryden, Behn, Swift, Pope, and Fielding are read in the context of
political and social revolutions, the African slave trade, and the growth of modern capitalism.</p>
<p><B>The Romantic Period</B> considers the outburst of literary creativity in such poets as Blake,
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats and such prose writers as Wollstonecraft, Scott,
Austen, and Mary Shelley, in the context of revolutionary politics, encounters with nature and the
rise of industrialized, consumer capitalism.</p>
<p><B>The Victorian Period</B>, a time of British political and cultural dominance, examines the work
of such writers as Tennyson, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Dickens, and the Brontës, in the
context of scientific, industrial and colonial growth, religious skepticism, and challenges to class
and gender inequalities.</p>
<p><B>Modern British Literature</B> focuses on the literature reflecting modern turbulence, innovation,
and alienation, as in Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, and Eliot, in the context of World War, social and
economic crises, and radical artistic experimentalism.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="english-233"></a>233 Children's and Young Adult Literature</p>
<p>Students read and discuss children's literature from a variety of cultures and time periods.
Beginning with world folklore and children's classics as background, students explore an array
of picture books, poetry, fiction, and nonfiction that exemplifies the best in fantasy, science
fiction, and realism for children and young adults. Special emphasis is given to two relatively
new subgenres: multicultural literature and the contemporary problem novel.  Prerequisite: FYW or
