              <h6> <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/stolaf/depts/classics/">http://www.stolaf.edu/stolaf/depts/classics/</a> </h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2008-09:</strong> Anne H. Groton, Greek and Roman drama</span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong> Christopher M. Brunelle, Latin poetry; James M. May, Greek and Roman rhetoric; Mary McMenomy, Greek drama and religion; Steve Reece, Greek and Roman epic</span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Long  ago the Greeks and Romans conceived the idea of the liberal arts and  made them the basis of higher education. Today the Department of  Classics keeps that classical tradition alive at St. Olaf by offering  courses in the languages, literature, and culture of ancient Greece and  Rome. The study of Graeco-Roman civilization gives students perspective on their own place in history while increasing their understanding of the world into which Christianity was born.</span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Many  students satisfy the foreign language requirement with three semesters  of Greek or Latin. Greek is especially helpful for pre-seminary and  pre-medicine students, Latin for pre-law students. Either language makes a good match with the Great Conversation program. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Every term the Department of Classics offers at least one course that demands no knowledge  of Greek or Latin and fulfills general education requirements; among  the most popular of these classics courses are Greek and Roman Myth  (Classics 241) and the annual Interim in Greece (Classics 251). </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students often combine a major in Greek or Latin with another major. A classical background  enriches one&rsquo;s experiences in college and in later life, while the  verbal and analytical skills acquired by learning classical languages  are of lasting benefit in whatever career one chooses. </p>
            </div>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJORS </h5>
              <p class="body"> Three  different majors in classical language are available to St. Olaf  students: Greek, Latin, and classics. The classics major combines Greek  and Latin and is the most rigorous. All three majors have as their  objectives understanding of classical language at an advanced level,  skill in translating and analyzing classical literature of different genres, and basic knowledge about classical civilization. Potential Latin teachers  may complete a Latin education major. <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/classics/">Ancient studies</a> and<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/classics/"> medieval  studies</a>, two interdisciplinary majors overseen by the Department of  Classics, are described elsewhere in this catalog. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p class="body"> To  attain distinction in classics, a student must demonstrate talent with  classical languages and literature, skill in conducting research on a  classical topic, and broad knowledge of classical civilization.

St. Olaf offers a Latin major with teaching  license for students preparing to teach Latin in K-12 schools. Students  pursuing a full K-6, K-12, 5-12, or 9-12 license in another content  area may earn a K-8 specialty in Latin teaching with an endorsement to  their other license. Education 349 is a teaching methods course  designed specifically for future Latin instructors. Students may put  their Greek or Latin courses to use as the core of an interdisciplinary  major in ancient studies or medieval studies. </span></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-252"></a>252 Vergil and Latin Epic</p>
<p>Lord Tennyson called Vergil the "wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of
man."  Students encounter that stately measure when they translate selections from Vergil's three

Homer's influence on Vergil and of Vergil's influence on the literature, art, and music of Western

Catullus, Horace, Tibullus, and Ovid and learn to recognize the features that make lyric a
distinctive genre of Latin poetry. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-372"></a>372 Latin Historians</p>
<p>The writings of Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus provide breathtaking views of ancient Rome and
memorable vignettes from the city's colorful history. Extended passages from the historians' works,
read in Latin, form the basis for a survey of Roman historiography and of historical writing in
general.  Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-373"></a>373 Lucretius and Latin Poetry</p>
<p>Lucretius might best be described as a philosophical poet. His <I>De Rerum Natura</I> ("On the
Nature of the Universe") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus
and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating
poem.  Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-374"></a>374 Cicero and Latin Prose</p>

prose style. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-375"></a>375 Latin Drama</p>

reading. Students in the course translate selected plays and discuss the evolution of the Roman
theater, staging, and modern interpretations. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every
third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-377"></a>377 Latin Satire</p>
<p>The Romans claimed that satire was a literary genre of their own creation. Students are able to

              <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-126"></a>126 Ancient Comedy: A Funny Thing Happened</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the wild and wacky world of ancient Greek and Roman

Offered periodically during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-128"></a>128 The Fall of the Roman Empire and the Rise of Christianity</p>
<p>This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the roughly 300-year period of Western
European history from the Fall of the Roman Empire to the establishment of the 6th-century
Christian Germanic kingdoms. Using primary sources, archaeological evidence, and remains of art
and architecture, students investigate the collapse of Roman authority and the rise of the
Christian Church, gaining insight into an age of great transition and change.  Offered
periodically during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-129"></a>129 The Neverending Myth: Ovid's <I>Metamorphoses</I></p>
<p>Ovid was the most witty and popular Roman poet of his time, and his 12,000-line <I>Metamorphoses</I>
has influenced more European literature and art than any other classical Latin text.  By analyzing
two modern English translations and studying other poems, stories, and artwork based on the
<I>Metamorphoses</I>, students gain an understanding of the nature of Ovid's storytelling and the
power that it has exerted on our cultural tradition.  No knowledge of Latin required.  Offered
periodically during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-241"></a>241 Greek and Roman Myth</p>
<p>For the Greeks and Romans myth was a cultural reality, just as it is for us.  Students in this
course read the famous tales told by the poets Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
Vergil, and Ovid, and ponder the deeper truths contained in their works of fiction.  The class also
explores the use of classical myth in later literature and its manifestations in art, music, and
drama from ancient to modern times.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-243"></a>243 The Golden Age of Greece</p>
