                <p class="body">The licensure program extends student development  in disciplinary content and in pedagogy, which meets or exceeds  Minnesota Board of Teaching Rules 8710.4800: Standards for Teachers of Social Studies. In addition to courses and student teaching,  requirements include passing Praxis I and Praxis II standardized tests  and observations and teaching in classroom settings, including one in a  setting of diversity.
