              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong> Deborah J. Anderson, clinical and health psychology; Harry Brull, industrial/organizational psychology;  Grace Cho, developmental psychology; Shelly Dickinson, conditioning and learning, behavioral neuroscience; James Dickson, Jr., experimental, comparative, and biopsychology; Scott Gregory, industrial/organizational psychology;   Charles W.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  Department of Psychology is committed to maintaining a rigorous  academic curriculum within a supportive community structure. It seeks  to address broad questions posed by a liberal education and specific concerns of individual students. St. Olaf College&rsquo;s mission statement  provides a framework for curriculum, personal development, and  community relations. Because life is more than facts and theories, the  Psychology Department encourages students to be &ldquo;responsible citizens  dedicated to service,&rdquo; as well as scientific &ldquo;seekers of truth.&rdquo; </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Psychology courses contribute to general education by fulfilling both foundation studies  (ORC and WRI) and core studies (HBS, NSL, EIN, NST/IST and SED, MCS-D, MCS-G). They  introduce the disciplinary knowledge that nurtures growth and  behavioral change while providing background for advanced study.  Psychology contributes to majors in social work, family studies, and nursing, to concentrations in   environmental studies, asian studies, linguistic studies, neuroscience, and  women&rsquo;s studies and to the psychology core of the social studies  education major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Psychology  majors are prepared for graduate and professional programs in  psychology, medicine, law, physical therapy, social work, nursing, and  ministry and for entering positions in business, government, or  industry. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The Department of Psychology follows the American Psychological Association&rsquo;s guidelines of &ldquo;synthesizing  the natural and social science aspects of the discipline, in part, by  requiring students to take courses in both knowledge bases.&rdquo; Thus both  interpersonal and investigative skills are enhanced. Students benefit  from research in the library, laboratory, and field, as well as from  internships. Through course structure and faculty diversity, the  department challenges students to think critically and creatively as  they investigate  ways in which animals, especially humans, adapt to their environment  through biological, social, emotional, spiritual, perceptual,  behavioral, linguistic, and cognitive processes. </p>

human development. Major changes in physical, cognitive, personality and social development are
discussed.  Prerequisite: Psychology 125.  Offered each semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-249"></a>249 Social Psychology</p>
<p>Why are people prejudiced and how can we reduce prejudice? Why do people help others?  What is
self-esteem and how do we defend it? How does romantic attraction develop? What are emotions and
how do they influence us? In this introduction to the ways people interact and think about each
other, students design their own theories of social behavior. Prerequisite: Psychology 125.
Offered each year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-250"></a>250 Industrial/Organizational Psychology</p>

industry. Topics include organizational structure, personnel management, employee-supervisor
relationships, job satisfaction and motivation, communication and leadership. Prerequisite:
Psychology 125, Statistics 110, 212 or 263.  Offered Spring Semester only.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-255"></a>255 Environmental Psychology at Rocky Mountain National Park</p>
<p>This course investigates the human relationship with the natural world, examining ways in which the
natural environment is important psychologically to human beings.  Integrating aspects of
theoretical and empirical psychology, environmental studies and literature, we explore meanings,
values and questions such as: How are we affected by nature?  What affects people's attitudes
and behaviors toward the environment?  How do we respond to environmental challenges?  How
does the field of psychology address the natural world?  Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or
Environmental Studies 137.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-264"></a>264 Psychopathology</p>
<p>Why are certain experiences or patterns of behavior considered psychologically "abnormal?"
Students investigate a wide array of psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders,
depression, eating disorders and schizophrenia. We examine models used to conceptualize
abnormal behavior, as well as current evidence and theories regarding the etiology and treatment of
these important and sometimes devastating disorders.  Not open to first-year students.
Prerequisite: Psychology 125.  Offered each semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-271"></a>271 Psychology of Personality</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-338"></a>338 Neurobiology of Psychopathology</p>
<p>With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many
psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. In this
discussion-based course, students use published research findings to examine the connections
between the symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, biochemistry, and
physiology. Prerequisites: Psychology 231, 264, and 238, or Neuroscience 234.  Offered alternate
years.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-375"></a>375 Clinical/Counseling Psychology</p>
<p>This course examines several major theoretical perspectives on psychotherapy.  Students review
empirically supported treatments for specific clinical disorders, as well as "nonspecific" factors
that affect the therapeutic process.  Students explore ethical and legal challenges related to
psychotherapy delivery, as well as multicultural and other diversity issues.  Course format is
primarily discussion-based.  This course is only open to juniors and seniors and is offered most
years.  Prerequisites: Psychology 231, and 264 or 271.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-378"></a>378 Health Psychology</p>
<p>What is the mind-body connection?  We explore the major issues, theories, and interventions in
health psychology.  Students review evidence for the impact of psychological and behavioral factors
on the immune system and health. Psychosocial approaches to the major diseases, their rationale,
and the evidence supporting these interventions are examined.  Introductory biology and
psychopathology strongly recommended. Prerequisite: Psychology 231, 264, and 238 or Biology 123 or
125.  Offered most years.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-385"></a>385 Human Neuropsychology</p>
<p>Complex cognitive processes such as memory, language and spatial perception have a neurological
basis.  This course provides the opportunity to examine the relationship between human brain
structures and their expression in cognition. Students examine cerebral asymmetry, head trauma,
learning disabilities and aphasia. The course includes three hours lecture and three hours
laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Psychology 231, and 238 or Neuroscience 234; completion of
BTS-T.  Offered each year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-390"></a>390 Issues in Psychology</p>
<p>Seminars allow in-depth study of particular themes or topics in psychology.  Prerequisite:
Psychology 231.  See department website for descriptions and additional prerequisites.  May be
repeated if topics are different.  Offered most years.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-391"></a>391 Topics:</p>
<p><B>Sample Topic:</B> The Psychology of Good and Evil</p>
<p>Why do we feel it is important to judge behavior as morally good or bad?  How do we make these
judgments?  What makes it possible for people to commit acts of extraordinary heroism or evil?
Good answers to these questions require knowledge of philosophical and theological ethics and of
the empirical work on moral action and judgment.  Students read both and ask how they do (and
should) inform each other.  Prerequisite: Psychology 231 and Psychology 249.</p>
