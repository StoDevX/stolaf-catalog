              <p class="programdescription"> The  Asian Studies Department provides students with the opportunity to  study East Asia and Southeast Asia. The department offers  an Asian studies major and concentrations in Asian studies, China studies, and Japan studies. A concentration in Asian studies &mdash;  which presumes that a student completes a major in another department &mdash;  is ideal for students with an interest in Asia who are majoring in  economics, history, religion, anthropology,  art, political science, or other areas. St. Olaf offers many  international programs in Asia. The concentrations in China and Japan  studies allow students to pursue advanced language study with or without an Asian studies major. </p>

Chinese art. A major theme is to define "visual culture" in all its nuances.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="asian-275"></a>275 Interdisciplinary Approaches to Asia</p>

and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [are] the foundation of freedom,
