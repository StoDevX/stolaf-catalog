              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2008-09:</strong> Todd Nichol, immigration and Scandinavian history</span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2008-09:</strong> J. Laurel Carrington, medieval, Renaissance and Reformation; Gary DeKrey, Reformation and early modern Europe, Tudor and Stuart England, modern Britain; Jeane DeLaney, Latin American history and nationalism, Argentina and Brazil, modern Cuba; Robert Entenmann, East Asian history, Asian studies; James J.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">History  explores the many facets of the human condition from the past to the  present. History invites those who study it to develop an appreciation  for the variety of human experiences. Demonstrating how the past shapes  the present, the study of history also encourages an understanding  of different world cultures, societies, and outlooks in their own  terms. Students learn to analyze and to think critically about a broad  range of issues and experiences. They also learn how to develop  reasoned arguments and explanations from historical evidence. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Among  St. Olaf departments, the History Department is distinctive in the  variety of courses it offers for the college&rsquo;s interdisciplinary  programs. These courses are described here; and they are also listed in  such program descriptions as American studies, Asian studies, environmental  studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. In addition, history courses fulfill  several different general education requirements, according to subject  matter. The department is a major provider of HWC, MCS-G, MCS-D, and  WRI courses. Some history courses count toward ALS-L and HBS. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of history provides students with liberal arts preparation for a  wide range of professional and personal vocations. Most history majors  pursue careers in such fields as business, education, law, and government service. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">St. Olaf&rsquo;s history offerings are structured to help students achieve different learning goals at different levels. In Level I seminars, students approach history as a way of learning, through the critical reading of primary sources on specific historical topics. In Level I foundational surveys, they explore the broad historical  development of the world&rsquo;s major societies and cultures. In most Level  II courses, students examine more specialized national, area, and  topical developments. In Level II major seminars, students develop  their skills of analysis, interpretation, argumentation, and  expression. Finally, Level III seminars challenge students to recognize  historical problems and to formulate their own questions about major  historical issues, entering the ongoing debates of historians. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> History courses at Level I do not have prerequisites. Level I seminars are only open to first-year students;  Level I foundational surveys are open to everybody. History courses at  Level II generally do not have prerequisites either, since many of them  count for general education credit. The major seminars at Level II are  especially designed for history majors, although other students may  enroll as space permits. Level III courses generally require  significant prior preparation; students with little or no background in  a particular area or period should consult with the instructor before  registration. </p>
            </div>
            <h5 class="goldhead">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</h5>
            <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html">https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html</a></p>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> History  majors are required to take nine courses, including one Level II major  seminar and three courses at Level III. Three Level I courses (but no  more than two seminars) may count toward the major. Students must take  at least one course in each of three general areas, i.e., Europe,  United States, and the non-Western  world (Africa, Asia, Latin America). This area requirement should be  fulfilled in Level I or Level II courses. At least two courses in the  major must deal with the pre-modern period; see the departmental  website or the History Department chair for the approved list of  pre-modern courses. Other courses may meet this requirement if approved  by the department chair. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p class="body"> Senior  majors who seek a significant intellectual experience and who  demonstrate high achievement in historical research and writing may  apply for departmental distinction. Candidates must satisfy minimum  grade point average requirements (3.30 overall, 3.50 in the major),  prepare a paper under the direction of an adviser in the department and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  to the chair of the Distinction Committee by Nov. 15 of their senior  year. The formal review begins in mid-March. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">The History Department supports several other programs: </span></p>
              <ol>
                <li class="body"> The  social studies education major (see SOCIAL STUDIES EDUCATION) with a  primary core in history is appropriate for those considering a career  in high school teaching. In addition to the general  requirements for the social studies education major (see EDUCATION  catalog description and faculty), students in this major are required  to complete a primary core that includes History 191 and another course  in European history; History 198 and 199; and History 195 or a course  in Asian, African, or Latin American history. </li>
                <li class="body"> The  interdisciplinary historical perspectives concentration enables  students to create a coherent group of five courses (from within and  without the History Department) about a particular era, theme, or  region of the world. See HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES for additional  information. </li>
                <li class="body"> The Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) program offers students opportunities to integrate  their foreign-language skills with the study of history. Students in  specially designated history classes can use their Greek, Latin,  Spanish, French, German, Russian, or Chinese so that nothing is lost to  them in translation! </li>
                <li class="body"> History courses taken in St. Olaf off-campus programs can often be counted toward the major. Students who wish to count off-campus courses toward the major should seek approval from the department chair before beginning their programs. Some restrictions apply. </li>
                <li class="body"> Historical internships with academic content may also be accepted for major credit. </li>
              </ol>

States.  The course examines how this experience has shaped ethnic and racial identities,

from Europe to Latin America and Asia.  Offered periodically.</p>
