                <p> <span class="programdescription">Mathematics,  as the study of patterns and order, is a creative art, a language, and  a science. The practice of mathematics combines the aesthetic appeal of  creating patterns of ideas with the utilitarian appeal of applications  of these same ideas. As the language of physical science, mathematics  is also used increasingly to model phenomena in the biological and  social sciences. Mathematical literacy is indispensable in today&rsquo;s society. As part of the Department of Mathematics,  Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS), members of the mathematics  faculty strive to help students understand natural connections among  these related but distinct disciplines. </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Mathematics  at St. Olaf is interesting, exciting, accessible, and an appropriate  area of study for all students. Each year, seven to ten percent of  graduating seniors complete mathematics  majors. The department offers courses representing various mathematical  perspectives: theoretical and applied, discrete and continuous,  algebraic and geometric, and more. Our faculty also teach courses in  statistics, computer science, and mathematics education. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> A  concentration in statistics and a major in computer science are also  available. Courses in these areas are taught by faculty from the  Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. For further information on these, consult the separate listings under <a href="statistics.html">STATISTICS</a> and <a href="comp-sci.html">COMPUTER SCIENCE</a>. </p>

            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR 
              </h5>
              </p>
            <p><span class="body">Students  arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized  Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent  program of study consistent with the goals of the individual student.  The courses included in a student&rsquo;s IMaP are determined after  consultation with an MSCS faculty member and approved by the department  chair. </span></p>
            <p class="body"> A path through the major as described by a student&rsquo;s IMaP normally includes two semesters of calculus,  one semester of linear algebra, and at least seven intermediate or  advanced mathematics courses. The intermediate courses should include  two transition courses (from among Math 244, Math 252, and Math 242)  and courses from at least three different mathematical perspectives  (computation/modeling, continuous/analytic,  discrete/combinatorial, axiomatic/algebraic). Students must take at  least two Level III courses, at least one of which must be part of a  designated Level II&ndash;Level III sequence. </p>
                <p class="body"> An IMaP may include up to two related courses from Statistics or Computer Science; a current listing  of such courses is available on the mathematics web page. A student may  also find a course outside of MSCS that contributes significantly to a  mathematical path of study and may petition to have the course included  in his or her IMaP. </p>
                <p class="body"> Mathematics  majors who intend to teach grades 5-12 mathematics must meet the above  requirements (see also EDUCATION description and the Mathematics  Licensure Adviser). Their IMaPs must include Mathematics 232, 244, 252,  262, and 356, a course in statistics, and Education 350 in order to  meet the State of Minnesota licensure requirements. Students wishing to  add grades 5-8 mathematics licensure to a non-mathematics teaching  major should also submit an IMaP. Course requirements include calculus,  linear algebra, discrete mathematics, statistics and geometry, as well as Education 350. </p>
                <p class="body"> Students should consult the mathematics program web page (www.stolaf.edu/depts/math) for lists of courses that satisfy each perspective, lists of sequence courses, and other useful information. </p>

                  <li><span class="body"> Study abroad: The IMaP&rsquo;s flexibility allows study abroad programs to fit well into a student&rsquo;s mathematics  major. Students interested in a program focused on upper-level  mathematics should consider the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="body"> Problem solving and competitions: The department supervises a problem-solving seminar and sponsors  student participation in regional and national competitions. St. Olaf  also hosts its own annual mathematics competition, the Carlson  Contests. </span></li>

                <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY </h5>
                <p class="body"> Students  planning graduate work in the mathematical sciences should pursue  opportunities that add both depth and breadth to their majors. Courses  across a broad range of the curriculum will help students prepare for the Mathematics Graduate Record Exam. Taking many Level III courses will help students prepare  for their first year of graduate school. Research experiences (on- or  off-campus) and independent studies will help students learn whether or  not they are truly interested in further mathematical studies. </p>

analytically. These transformations are generalized to obtain results in projective geometry
or used to generate fractals in an exploration of fractal geometry.  Dynamic geometry software
and hands-on labs are used to explore both the transformations and properties of these
geometries. Prerequisite: Mathematics 220 and 244 or 252.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="math-364"></a>364 Combinatorics</p>
<p>This course covers basic enumeration, including generating functions, recursion,
inclusion-exclusion, Polya theory, etc. Students also explore topics in graph theory and
constructive combinatorics, time permitting. Prerequisite: Mathematics 252; some previous exposure
to counting methods (e.g., Mathematics 262) is helpful. Offered in 2007-08 and alternate years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="math-370"></a>370 Mathematical Logic</p>
<p>Mathematical logic uses mathematical methods to analyze reasoning and to examine what
mathematics can and cannot do. It also provides the underlying paradigm on which intelligent
computer systems are based. Initially, students study the language and rules of inference of
predicate logic and investigate the relationships between provability and truth and between a
mathematical theory and its models. Later, they explore applications of logic to computer
science. Prerequisite: Mathematics 244 or 252. Offered periodically.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="math-382"></a>382 Topics in Analytic Mathematics</p>
<p>Students work intensively in a special topic of analytic character. Topics vary from year to
year.  May be repeated if topics are different.  Offered periodically.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="math-384"></a>384 Topics in Applied Mathematics</p>
<p>Students work intensively in a special topic of an applied character. Topics vary from year
to year.  May be repeated if topics are different.  Offered in 2007-08 and alternate years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"> 388 Seminar </p>
                <p class="coursename"><a name="math-390"></a>390 Mathematics Practicum</p>
<p>Students work in groups on significant problems posed by and of current interest to area
businesses and government agencies. The student groups decide on promising approaches to their
problem and carry out the necessary investigations with minimal faculty involvement. Each group
reports the results of its investigations with a paper and an hour-long presentation to the
sponsoring organization. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor. Offered during Interim.</p>
