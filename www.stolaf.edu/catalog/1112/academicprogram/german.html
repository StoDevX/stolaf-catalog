As the official language of Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein  as well as Germany, the world&rsquo;s largest exporter, German is the language with  the largest number of native speakers in the European Union. It is the native  language of a significant portion of the population in northern Italy, eastern  Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, eastern France, and parts of Poland, the  Czech Republic, Russia and Romania. It is the second-most commonly used  scientific language and the most widely spoken language in Europe. In a radius  of 1000 kilometers (625 miles), Germany lies at the center of a European  population of 300 million people, taking a decisive role in the political,  economic, and educational dynamics of the continent.</span></em></p>
              <p class="programdescription"><em>Studying  German offers students access to a culture of scientists and innovators,  philosophers and theologians, writers, artists and composers.

              <p class="programdescription"><em>The German  Department offers courses on campus and abroad in German language and culture,  including literature, history, and film for both majors and non-majors. A  pivotal component of German language study at St. Olaf is study abroad. In  keeping with a German tradition dating back to medieval times, German  universities today have opened their doors to students from around the world,  sharing their research in science and technology, their specialized training in  the fine arts, and their rich archival collections in the humanities, with only  one requirement: German language proficiency. With adequate proficiency in  German, St. Olaf students may study for a semester or a full year at the  University of Konstanz or the Humboldt University in Berlin.</em></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">In courses for the major, students gain an understanding of German culture, literature, and civilization as they develop analytical and communication skills in the spoken and written language. All courses for the German major are taught in German.</span></p>
              <p class="body">German majors are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of a variety of study abroad opportunities offered in semester and full-year programs as well as during the January Interim and the summer sessions. </p>
          <p class="body">Level II courses beyond the language requirement are divided into two sequences. </p>
              <p class="body">In  250-level courses, students focus intensively on development of their  language skills while learning to engage in close study of visual and written texts. These  courses, targeted primarily at first- and second-year  students, provide an introduction to the content areas of the major while sharpening specific critical and linguistic skills. The targeted proficiency level is  Intermediate High according to a standard set by American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). 250-level courses are not sequential and all have the same level of difficulty; a higher 250-number does not indicate a greater level of difficulty. All 250-level courses count toward the German major and are open to non-majors. </p>
              <p class="body">In  270-level courses, students continue to explore new content areas in German culture while at the same time advancing language skills and developing writing strategies for reseach papers. Courses at this level are designed to prepare students for level III  research work in German. The targeted proficiency level is ACTFL Intermediate High. 270-level courses are not sequential and all have the same level of difficulty; a higher 270-number does not indicate a greater level of difficulty. Most study-abroad courses taught in German count toward the 270-level. </p>
          <p class="body"> Level  III courses  build upon students&rsquo; interpretive skills and the knowledge of the German-speaking world  gained in 270-level courses, as well as  through study in Germany. Students examine in depth a particular genre, author, or topic through the analysis and interpretation of representative works. The targeted proficiency level is ACTFL Advanced. </p>
          <p class="body"> Students  need not be German majors to take level II and III courses or to study  abroad. Most begin their study of German in the 231-232 sequence. They  complete this sequence and take at least one writing  course on campus at the 250-level or above before spending a semester  or a year studying in Germany. Courses taken in Germany may satisfy  general education requirements as well as requirements for the German  and/or other majors. </p>
              <p class="body">Courses taken abroad in English may count toward a major in other departments with prior approval. </p>
