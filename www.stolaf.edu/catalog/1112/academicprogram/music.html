Eligibility nominations are based on evidence of sustained academic and musical excellence. Eligible seniors will be notified by October 1.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead">Music Performance Studies</p>
              <p class="body">Music performance studies provide a direct opportunity to think and speak the language of music. Lessons integrate aspects of music's cultural and historical contexts, its theoretical properties, and the physical and psychological facets of performance. Music performance studies earn ALS-A credit. A full credit (4 semesters at the 0.25 credit level) of study on a single instrument or voice is required to meet the ALS-A comprehensive graduation requirement. All music performance studies courses are repeatable up to a total of eight times (ten times if a student is pursuing the <a href="../academiclife/bm-ge-requirements.html#babmdouble">double-degree option</a>).</p>
          <p class="body">Variable credit private lessons  are available in bassoon, clarinet, collaborative piano, composition, cornet, euphonium, flute, English  horn, French horn, Hardanger fiddle, harp, harpsichord, oboe, organ,  percussion, piano, jazz piano, saxophone, string bass, trombone,  trumpet, tuba, viola, violin, violoncello, and voice. Lessons are catalogued as level I and level II Music Performance Studies (MUSPF) courses, and course numbers are referenced in the St. Olaf class &amp; lab schedule.</p>
              <p class="body">Music performance studies are offered at three credit levels:</p>
      <blockquote>
                <p class="body">0.25 credit: weekly half-hour lessons, daily minimum one-hour practice expectation<br />
                  0.50 credit: weekly one-hour lessons, daily minimum two-hour practice expectation<br />
                  1.00 credit: weekly one-hour lessons, daily minimum three-hour practice expectation</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="body">Registration for all applied music lessons is processed through the Music Office (CHM 101). Elective private study for non-music majors (0.25 credit) is available on a space-available basis to students demonstrating sufficient skill level gained through prior study.</p>
              <p class="body">All students in the Bachelor of Music program receive a lesson scholarship for principal instrument/voice study. Beginning in the sophomore year, Bachelor of Arts music majors also receive a lesson scholarship for principal instrument/voice study.</p>
              <p class="body">For all elective and secondary-instrument/voice performance studies, students are assessed a fee of $425 per 0.25 credit. Fees will be refunded only if a student drops the course by the 6th day of classes each semester. No refund is given thereafter.</p>
              <p class="body">Enrolled students are expected to participate in  studio classes, attend music department-approved events, and fulfill performance-related requirements as detailed by individual instructors. An individual performance jury is required each semester.</p>
          <p class="body">To perform solo on any official recital, students must be concurrently enrolled in lessons on the performing instrument/voice.</p>
