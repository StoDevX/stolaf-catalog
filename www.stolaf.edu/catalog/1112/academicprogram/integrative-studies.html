              <p class="programdescription"> In the Center for Integrative Studies (CIS), &ldquo;integrative studies&rdquo; refers to learning that intentionally  combines diverse methods, experiences, learning styles, subject  matters, and on- or off-campus resources. The college has a  long-standing commitment to integrative studies, evident in its many successful interdisciplinary majors and concentrations, in the 30-year history  of the St. Olaf Paracollege, and in the faculty&rsquo;s ability to combine  diverse approaches to course subjects. The CIS's principal activity is  to support students who plan and carry out individual, integrative  majors and help students to identify and pursue opportunities for  integrative learning on and off campus. In all these activities, the  CIS's goal is to enhance the coherence of students&rsquo; academic careers by  encouraging them to make meaningful connections among the many parts of  their educational experience and by helping them build bridges between  the college and other communities. The CIS also offers a small  curriculum of topical seminars that exemplify integrative learning. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">THE INDIVIDUAL MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  CIS is the academic home for students pursuing self-designed,  integrative majors. Students propose a sequence of courses, seminars,  independent studies, or experiential learning as the means of pursuing  an individual major. Proposals must include (1) a description of the  proposed subject matter; (2) a list of 10 or more proposed courses and  other learning experiences and an explanation of how each contributes  to the major; (3) an initial proposal for a two-semester senior  integrative project; and (4) a summary of the student&rsquo;s preparation to carry out the proposed major. Each proposal must have the support of a faculty academic advisor. The coherence, depth, and feasibility of each proposal are evaluated and approved by a faculty  review committee convened by the CIS. At the end of the senior year,  the student&rsquo;s work in the major is presented to a faculty certification  committee for review. Proposals for individual majors may be submitted  any time during the sophomore year and the first part of the junior  year. Recent individual majors 
include: Architecture and Design, Human Resource Psychology; International Relations and Ethics; Multimedia and Software Design; Intercultural Medical Practice; Multilingualism and 
              Multiculturalism; Social Innovation and Community Development; Christian Worship and the Visual Arts; Neuroscience; Studies of Conscience; Criminalistics; Social Marketing and the Environment; Writing for Performance; Political 
              Communication; Ecology of Wellness.</p>

                <h6> <span class="body">The Web Portfolio </span></h6>
                <p class="body"> Students  with individual majors create and maintain a web portfolio. A web  portfolio preserves important learning experiences and academic work.  Its web-based structure allows students to make explicit links within  their own work and to the work of other students or other sites of  public discussion. The web portfolio is presented to the faculty certification committee with the senior project at the end of the major. </p>

              <p class="body"> Faculty  teaching in the CIS offer integrative seminars on selected topics, open  to students in the sophomore year or later. These seminars model the  integration of tools and resources from various disciplines in new  approaches to their subjects. CIS seminars are normally repeated over  two successive years and then retired, but later may find a &ldquo;home&rdquo; in  another department or program. </p>

                <p class="coursename"> 201 Power Computing in All Disciplines</p>
                <p class="body">Computing is an integral component of academic pursuits and personal lives on college campuses. Developments in computing now provide opportunities to apply powerful computing techniques in any discipline. But few faculty outside computer science (CS) know about opportunities for large scale computing, and few CS students have experienced interdisciplinary, user-centered computing. This seminar brings together equal numbers of CS students and students in (non-CS) target disciplines to create interdisciplinary software applications for high-performance computing useful for teaching and/or research in those disciplines. Offered in spring 2012 and 2013.</p>
                <p class="coursename">204 Ethics and Global Service</p>
                <p class="body">Orphans, HIV/AIDS, abuse, poverty: many students want to address these global issues directly. Students study and apply ethical reasoning to decisions about serving abroad. Vocations of service invite the examination of motivation, values, needs, faith stances, and privilege. Through the lenses of Christian, multicultural, and feminist ethics and concepts of vocation, students sharpen their thinking about &quot;helping&quot; in another cultural context. Designed particularly for students interested in global careers in health, ministry, social welfare, education, and community development. Offered in Fall 2011 and 2012. Prerequisite: Completion of BTS-T, or permission of instructor.</p>
                <p class="coursename">214 Music in Film</p>
                <p class="body">The composer Igor Stravinsky said of film music that it should have &quot;the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading.&quot; Students encounter the ambiguity of an art that has such devastating emotional impact while often remaining unnoticed. They engage in both analysis of historical film scores and the creation of new film music in team-based collaborations. Offered in Spring 2012 and 2013.</p>
                <p class="coursename">218  Chronicles of the American Immigrant Experience</p>
                <p class="body">In this seminar, students will consider how immigrants work through their   national, ethnic, or racial heritage to contribute to the creative and spiritual   life of their new nation, and ways in which this collection of voices creates   harmony and/or dissonance. We will read novels, short stories, and poems, and   study private writings (letters and diaries), films, artworks, and other   artifacts, in the context of the history of American immigration and of issues   facing current immigrant groups. Offered in Spring 2012.</p>
                <p class="body"><span class="coursename">219 Collaborative Design</span></p>
                <p class="body">Students in this seminar will use design process as a technique to 
creatively and efficiently tackle large projects in a group setting. 
We will focus on the construction of a working Rube Goldberg Machine, 
a whimsical and creative yet complicated and demanding task, using the 
design process. Students will examine formal techniques for 
identifying goals, brainstorming ideas, establishing timelines,<br />
prototyping ideas, and creating formal presentations. Hands-on skills 
will also be taught and utilized throughout the construction process.<br />
A background in science is not necessary; it is in fact one goal of 
this seminar to bring together science and non-science majors in<br />
creative collaboration. Offered in Interim 2012.</p>
                <p class="goldsubhead"> INTEGRATIVE SENIOR PROJECT </p>
                <p class="body"> Students  with individual majors register for their senior integrative projects  in each semester of the senior year. The first semester, generally used  for research and other preparation in consultation with the student's  advisor, receives a P/N evaluation; the second semester, and final  presentation of the project,   receives a grade. A brief description of the student's major and senior  project appears on the official transcript. </p>
