      <h2 class="programname">Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI)</h2>
      <p><strong><u><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/academics/curi/">http://www.stolaf.edu/academics/curi/ </a></u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p class="faculty"><strong>Director,  2011-12:</strong> Julie Legler (Mathematics, Statistics,  and Computer Science), biostatistics, interdisciplinary research</p>
      <p><span class="faculty"><strong>Program  Coordinator, 2011-12:</strong> Susan Carlson</span> </p>
      <p class="programdescription">The  St. Olaf Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI) program  provides opportunities for St. Olaf students&nbsp;of all academic  disciplines&nbsp;to gain an in-depth understanding of a particular subject  through working closely with a St. Olaf faculty member in a research setting.</p>
      <p><span class="programdescription">CURI  promotes collaborations between students and faculty during the academic year  through directed undergraduate research (DUR) and during the summer, both on  and off-campus. Throughout the experience, students learn about how research is  performed in the discipline of their choice. The program is also a good  opportunity for students to reflect and further evaluate where their skills,  interests, and values best fit with their future professional  endeavors.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="programdescription">A  student interested in applying for the CURI program must be enrolled as a St.  Olaf student and be a rising sophomore, junior, or senior. There is no GPA  requirement that must be met in order to apply for the program, but a student&rsquo;s  academic record will be considered during the selection process.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="goldhead"><strong>RESEARCH  OPPORTUNITIES AT ST. OLAF</strong></span><strong><a name="Here" id="Here"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="body">Research opportunities can be discovered in a  variety of settings; talk to faculty members about their research or current projects.&nbsp; Posters hanging in the halls display recent  projects and help students identify a professor&rsquo;s area of study.&nbsp; Besides these informal exchanges, students  have several options to explore opportunities during the academic year and in  the summer.</p>
      <p class="goldhead"><strong>Summer research</strong></p>
      <p><span class="body">Typically, students do not  earn course credit for summer research because they are paid employees of the  college.&nbsp; The remuneration also includes  housing on campus.&nbsp; A general email announcement  inviting students to apply for summer research is sent to all students early in  the second semester.&nbsp; This email directs students to a list of  descriptions of projects for which faculty are seeking student collaborators.</span></p>
      <p class="goldhead"><strong>Academic year</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="body">There are several ways in  which students can participate in undergraduate research during the academic  year.&nbsp; Each department and program has  the option of offering a directed undergraduate research (DUR) for credit.&nbsp; These are listed in the class and lab  schedule in the Student Information System (SIS).&nbsp; Students are encouraged  to discuss these opportunities with associated faculty.&nbsp; As a second option, each spring, students who  have successfully completed Statistics 272 are invited to apply to be fellows  in the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIR) for the following academic  year.&nbsp; A recently awarded National Science Foundation (NSF) grant will  soon expand this program to mathematics and computer science students.&nbsp; &nbsp;More  information on the CIR is available at <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/academics/cir">www.stolaf.edu/academics/cir</a>.&nbsp; The CURI website  (www.stolaf.edu/academics/curi) posts current projects for further information.</span></p>
