              <p class="programdescription"> The well-being of individuals and families is  a national  and global concern, and the family as a focus for study in higher education  has increased in significance. Since many disciplines  contribute to the understanding of families, family studies is an  integrative field that synthesizes knowledge from liberal arts  disciplines, particularly biology, psychology, social work, sociology, and political  science. </p>

            <p class="coursename">Senior capstone experience </p>
            <p class="body">This requirement is an academic, credit-bearing experience completed during the senior year. It is designed to ensure that concentrators participate in an experience that applies basic knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts about families) to real families in a setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by the chair of the Department of Social Work and Family Studies <u>prior</u> to enrollment. A St. Olaf faculty member must teach or supervise the experience. The senior capstone experience results in a product or project that involves working with real families. It could be a panel or talk organized by the student(s), a pamphlet, a web site, a portfolio, an integrative paper, or another approved project. Through the experience, students  demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes for family studies.</p>

            <ul>
              <li class="body">Includes 50-80 hours devoted to direct experience with families;</li>

            <p class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate study</p>
            <p class="body">The concentration in family studies is designed to enable students to learn about families in both theory and practice; it is a course of study that can enhance student learning in  any major. This concentration is intended to help to prepare students entering careers with families including marriage and family therapy, education, and ministry, or to family practice in law, medicine, nursing, social work, or public policy. Students who intend to go directly to graduate school should also consider enrollment in a statistics course and a research methods course in social work, psychology, or sociology.</p>
