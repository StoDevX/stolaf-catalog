        <p class="programdescription">Writing is a primary means of learning in the liberal arts. Through courses in the writing program, students read, discuss, and write about significant human issues as they develop critical skills to write effectively. Courses in the writing program are designed to accommodate varying levels of academic preparation and English language learning.</p>
        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION </span></p>
        <p class="body">The writing program supports two general education requirements: FYW and WRI. Most students take Writing 111: First-Year Writing during the fall or spring semester of their first year. Writing 111 seminars focus on a variety of topics with emphasis on writing practice to fulfill FYW. Students may also fulfill the FYW requirement by successfully completing designated courses in <a href="americanconversations.html">American Conversations</a> or<a href="great-con.html"> The Great Conversation</a>, or through <a href="../academicregs/entering-stolaf.html">advanced placement credit. </a>Consult the director of writing or the registrar.</p>
        <p class="body">Students who may benefit from more writing instruction and practice enroll in a two-semester sequence, taking Writing 107: Introduction to Academic Writing or Writing 110: Critical Skills in Composition during the fall of their first year, and completing Writing 111 during the spring semester. For more about writing placement, see <a href="../academicregs/entering-stolaf.html">ENTERING ST. OLAF. </a></p>
