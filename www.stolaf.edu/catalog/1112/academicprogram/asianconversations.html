              <p class="programdescription">The goal of the Asian Conversations program is to provide students with an opportunity to incorporate an off-campus learning experience as well as language study into an extended discussion of the peoples and places that make up Asia. Offered as a sophomore-year sequence, Asian Conversations is open to all majors interested in studying Asia and Asian languages. Students who are studying Chinese or Japanese language are invited to apply for this three-course sequence, which includes an Interim program in China and Japan.</p>
              <p class="programdescription">Those accepted into the Asian Conversations program embark on a series of linked courses that explore &quot;Journeys through Asia.&quot; Asian Conversations is a learning community that introduces students to some of the key texts of Asia as well as key historical, cultural, political and linguistic constructs through an integrated sequence of three courses. Over that time students pursue conversations with three different faculty members about the issues that have shaped the development of Asian societies over the centuries, ending in the spring term with contemporary Asia.</p>

        <p class="coursename"><a name="asian-210"></a>210 Asian Conversations I: Mapping Journeys</p>
<p>How do pilgrims, travelers and migrants make sense of their journeys in Asia?  Students explore
maps, histories, tales, and guides that define Asia today and in years past, including several
classic Asian texts; study how cultural, linguistic, economic, religious, social, and political
connections and divisions create and sustain communities in Asia; and plan related projects
for their Interim course.  Prerequisite: Chinese 112 or Japanese 112 or permission of instructor.
Offered annually in the fall semester.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="asian-215"></a>215 Asian Conversations II: Encountering Asia</p>
<p>Students pursue guided fieldwork experience in the country whose language they study, either Japan
or China.  Activities and readings in this course build on the topics from Asian Studies 210 and
three semesters of language study.  Students continue to explore their understanding of Asia through
ethnographic observation, interviews, and site visits.  Students develop projects and follow
a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct "Asian" culture
and society today.  Prerequisite: Asian Studies 210.  Offered during Interim.</p>
            
            <p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="asian-216"></a>216 Asian Conversations II:  Encountering Asia in America</p>
<p>Students pursue guided fieldwork experience in the United States.  Activities and readings in this
course build on the topics from Asian Studies 210 and three semesters of language study.  Students
reflect on  the experience of Asians in America through readings, site visits, and local
interviews.  Students develop projects and follow a process of inquiry that will help them
understand how ordinary people construct "Asian" culture and society today. Prerequisite: Asian
Studies 210.  Offered during Interim.</p>

            </p>
        <p class="coursename"><a name="asian-220"></a>220 Asian Conversations III: Interpreting Journeys</p>
<p>Having looked at how people journey through Asia, this final semester in Asian Conversations
considers how ideas travel over time and space. Students examine a range of interpretations of
Asia, including the spiritual, literary, philosophical and linguistics. Students are required to
publicly present the ideas gathered from contacts made during Interim at the beginning of the
semester. Additional materials include memoirs, novels, and films that share individualized
interpretations of Asian journeys.  Prerequisite: Chinese 231 or Japanese 231 and Asian Studies
215 or 216.  Offered annually in the spring semester.</p>
