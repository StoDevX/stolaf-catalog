              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2011-12:</strong> Kimberley Anderson, second language acquistion; Jolene Barjasteh, 19th-century French literature, autobiography (on leave fall semester and Interim); M. Amine Bekhechi, 20th-century French and Francophone literature; Jean E. Biem, Subsaharan Africa, critical theory; Mary Cisar, 18th-century French literature, feminist criticism, Franco-Manitoban studies; Lise Hoy, 19th-century literature, second language acquisition</span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">French  holds an important position among the world&rsquo;s languages. More than 200  million people around the world &mdash; in North and South America, the  Caribbean, Europe, Afrdeica, the Middle East, the Pacific and Indian  Oceans, and Indochina &mdash; speak French. French remains, with English, one  of the two languages into which all United Nations documents must be  translated.  Thus, students considering careers in business, diplomacy, the church,  or teaching are well advised to complete a major in French, sometimes  along with another major. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> By studying French and other Francophone cultures, civilizations, and literatures, students develop and enhance oral and written language skills, analytical thinking, and familiarity with diverse philosophies and perspectives, all of which are central to liberal arts education with a global perspective. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  French section of the Department of Romance Languages offers a variety  of courses, on campus and abroad, in French language, Francophone  cultures/civilizations, and literatures for beginning, intermediate, and advanced students, both majors and non-majors. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> To  expand students&rsquo; exposure to French beyond the classroom, the French  program hosts a weekly French conversation table and film series and  sponsors an honor house (Maison fran&ccedil;aise). </p>

              <p> <span class="body">In courses for the major, students gain understanding of Francophone literatures, civilizations, and contemporary cultures as they develop analytical and communication skills in the language. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> 200-level  courses are divided into two sequences. In 250-level courses, students  practice and refine their emerging language skills through textual  analysis, writing, and discussion. In 270-level courses, students explore the diverse cultures and literatures of the Francophone world. </p>
              <p class="body"> 300-level  courses build upon the interpretive skills and knowledge of the  Francophone world acquired by students in 270-level courses. 300-level  courses examine a particular topic or genre as well as critical or  theoretical issues associated with it through the analysis of  representative works. </p>
