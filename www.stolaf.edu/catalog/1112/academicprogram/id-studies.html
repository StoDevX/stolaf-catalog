students represent a variety of disciplines, this course serves as a general introduction to
writing in research; it is not meant to replace discipline-specific research methods or writing
courses. Students read scholarly literature in their disciplines, write a literature review, draft
various sections of a research paper, and prepare for a formal poster presentation. Offered every

primary and specialty areas and in practices dealing with all age groups.  Emergency health care and
physician support areas are other aspects of medicine to which students will be exposed.  Students
will keep a journal detailing their observations and their interpretation of and reaction to these
observations and will write a research paper on an aspect of current medical care and practice.
