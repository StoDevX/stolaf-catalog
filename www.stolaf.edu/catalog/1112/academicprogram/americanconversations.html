          <p> <span class="programdescription">American  Conversations is a learning community that introduces students in their  first two years to the liberal arts through an integrated sequence of  four courses. Over that time students pursue conversations that have shaped  the history and culture of the United States and seek to live Thomas  Jefferson&rsquo;s dream that free and educated citizens should learn to  understand what is going on in the world and to keep their part of it  going right. </span></p>
              <p class="goldhead">overview of the program</p>
               <p><span class="body">Like the college&rsquo;s other conversations programs, American Conversations is open to students  of all interests who like to read, discuss, write about ideas, and look  at issues through the lenses of several disciplines at once. Each  course combines the study of history, literature and other arts, race, ethnicity, and a variety of human and behavioral sciences  to provide students with a starting point for gaining greater lifelong  inquiry into American thought and values.</span> </p>
              <p class="body"> One faculty member who teaches American Conversations remains with students through  four courses in the sequence and teams with a second professor from a  different area of study each semester. Students live in the same  residence hall during their first year, enjoy some meals and special  events together, and  create a support system and  learning community prior to the time when most students select a major. </p>

<p>In this century of institutional development, national expansion, and sectional conflict, Americans
continued to define a national identity. Students probe the ways in which region, religion, race,
ethnicity, and gender inform individual and group contributions to the conversation. They also
analyze how geographical expansion and ideas of progress influenced different visions and
versions of America. Topics and texts range from Transcendentalist writers, the Second Great
Awakening, and <I>Black Elk Speaks</I> to landscape painting and Western photography.  Prerequisite:

women, an influx of immigrants, and the migration of African Americans to urban centers -- all
opened questions of freedom of expression, distribution of resources, and American identity.
