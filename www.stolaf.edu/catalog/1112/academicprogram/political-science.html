              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2011-12:</strong> J. Patrick Dale, comparative politics, Russian, Eurasian, and European politics</span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2011-12:</strong> Jo Beld, American politics, public policy; Douglas Casson, political theory, American constitutional law;  Henri&#1105;t Hendricks, American politics, analytical methodology, political psychology; Daniel Hofrenning, American politics, public policy;    Anthony Lott, international relations, global enviromental politics;  Katherine Tegtmeyer Pak, comparative politics, Asian politics, international relations; Kris Thalhammer, comparative politics, Latin American politics </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Political  science is the systematic study of government, politics, and public  policies in the United States and around the world. Students in  political science courses learn to frame thoughtful questions, consider  diverse perspectives, marshal convincing evidence, and communicate  with clarity and conviction about the major issues of public life. </span></p>
              <p><span class="programdescription">Many  political science courses at St. Olaf satisfy general education requirements (see  below). The Political Science Department shares faculty and courses  with American studies, Asian studies, environmental studies, Hispanic  studies, Russian studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. It also cooperates with  the Education Department in its social studies education major. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of political science is often combined with majors in English,  economics, history, philosophy, foreign language, or any of a number of  interdisciplinary majors and concentrations.  Many political science students go on to complete graduate and  professional degrees, not only in political science but also in law,  education, public policy, international affairs, management  and administration, or communications. Our graduates become policy  analysts, teachers, legislators, advocates, attorneys, business owners,  consultants, public relations managers,  ambassadors, administrators, researchers, and journalists. The study of  political science enriches students&rsquo; experience of the liberal arts and  prepares them to engage in public life as responsible citizens and  reflective leaders. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The political science major provides broad exposure to the discipline and develops skills in critical thinking, systematic inquiry, and effective writing and speaking. Students majoring in political science complete courses in four areas: American politics and public policy, comparative politics, international relations,  and political theory. Political science majors also encounter and apply  a variety of approaches to studying political behavior and public  policy, with particular emphasis on social scientific inquiry. Advanced  seminars and independent study courses provide opportunities for  specialized study and advanced research. Off-campus courses,  internships, and other experiential learning experiences engage  students with the realities of public life. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/polisci.htm">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
              <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Students majoring in political science must complete a minimum of nine courses in the discipline, including  no more than three level I courses, one course introducing research  methods Political Science 220,<em> Analyzing Politics and Policy</em>, and no  fewer than two level III courses. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Majors must include at least one course from each of the four subfields: American politics and public policy  (Political Science 111, 204,  244, 246, 255, 272,   311); comparative  politics (112, 117,  240,   252,   264, 282, 283, 350, 367, 370, 382, 385; Asian Studies/Political Science 245, 250, 254); international  relations (119, 121, 234,  257, 258,  285, 321; Asian Studies/Political Science 245) and political theory  (113,  119, 232,  259, 260, 270, 278, 284, 384). The subfield designation of  political science topics (299), independent study (298),  independent research (398), seminar (399), Interim courses or other  courses not listed above depends on the content of the advisors course in a  given semester; students should consult with their advisors and with the department academic administrative assistant to determine  the appropriate subfield for one of these courses. All level III  courses are offered as seminars with two prerequisites: Political Science 220 and one  other course in the relevant subfield. </p>
              <p class="body"> Students  may designate a selected statistics course   OR one additional semester of language beyond the level of proficiency  required for general education (French, German, or Spanish numbered  above 232 or Chinese, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Norwegian, or Russian  numbered above 231) as one of their nine courses in the political  science major. Additional study in statistics and/or foreign language  is especially recommended for students considering graduate study. </p>
              <p class="body"> Political  science majors are also encouraged to seek out opportunities for  experiential or applied study through internships, off-campus study,  on-campus courses with an experiential component, or independent  projects under faculty supervision. Up to two off-campus courses  instructed by non-St. Olaf faculty may be included in the major. An  internship for academic credit may also count toward the major,  although internships cannot be used to satisfy subfield requirements.  Additional suggestions and guidelines  for including off-campus work and experiential study in the political  science major are available in the department; students are encouraged  to consult with their advisors in making their plans. </p>

and politics but also to motivate them to be active and informed participants.  Offered annually.
Counts towards American studies major.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-112"></a>112 Comparative Politics</p>
<p>Why do some societies have democratic political systems and others authoritarian ones? What

others will arise from contemporary debates about political issues and cultural diversity within
the U.S. The course pays considerable attention to historical shifts in political thought but is
not designed to provide a chronology of the great Western political thinkers. Instead, this course
aims to provoke and sustain a semester-long exploration of what it means to be a political actor --
that is, a citizen -- and what it means to think about politics.  Offered annually.</p>
