              <p class="programdescription">The Department of Dance aspires to present and teach dance as a vital   form of human communication, expression, and interaction central to both   liberal arts and fine arts educational traditions. The dance experience   at St. Olaf engages students in the study of dance as a personal art, a   cultural art, and a fine art, aspiring to weave the three into a   satisfying whole<em>.</em> The B.A. in Dance prepares dance majors for a   range of vocational and a-vocational options including performing,   creating, teaching, and imagining dance into other fields. It also   provides majors with a solid background for continuing dance and   movement education. The dance program intends to inspire students toward   a life of possibility with strong physical intelligence at its   foundation. Students are guided to grow with attention to being a   moving, thinking, feeling, and imagining dancer.</p>
              <p class="programdescription">St. Olaf is a charter member and an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
               <p><span class="body">The Dance Department develops physical skills and awareness. The movement-intensive and language-intensive studies and experiences provided by the St. Olaf College B.A. in Dance equip majors with an entrepreneurial set of skills honed by creative, collaborative, analytical, communicative and disciplined work that are required of today's graduates. Recent dance alumnae manage, direct, and perform with professional companies or work as free-lance artists. Others pursue graduate study in dance therapy, teaching, choreography, performance, or the somatic disciplines. Dance students also come away from St. Olaf College with the ability to enter other fields, such as the healing professions, arts management, psychology, environmental studies, media, etc. In short, a B.A. in Dance from St. Olaf College prepares dance majors for a wide range of life and career possibilities and options, certainly including but not limited to dance.</span></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Dance  100, 124, 150, 201, 231,  246, 301, and 399 are the required language-intensive courses (theory courses) in the dance major. In addition, students select the equivalent of two credits in movement-intensive courses (technique courses) in consultation with dance faculty. One of these movement-intensive courses must be Dance 212: <em>Articulate Body</em>. Each student also designs an individualized area of specialty derived from their own interests and investigation. This  area of specialty consists of at least two credits selected from within and or outside the department. The dance major's area of specialty leads to the  creation and implementation of a Senior Dance Project, which is completed in conjunction with Dance 399: <em>Senior Dance Seminar</em> (must be taken fall of senior year). Sample areas of speciality have resulted in 1) the creation of a children's book teaching dance with a global perspective; 2) a piece of choreography that asks the question, Do numbers possess humanistic qualities?; 3) the performance of a solo dance that explores prejudices against the Latino immigrant community; and 4) a research paper presentation that examines gender in ballet and African American spectacle dance. The dance major curriculum is compatible with other majors.</span></p>
          <p class="body"> Majors  are required to participate in one of the dance companies (Companydance&trade;  or Veselica International Dance Ensemble) in both performance and production roles. Participation  must be planned in consultation with the dance faculty. </p>
