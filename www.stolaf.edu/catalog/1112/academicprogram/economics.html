              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMICS major </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Economics  is the study of how people and organizations make decisions, how they  interact with each other, and how institutions and policies can be  designed to improve people&rsquo;s lives. The ambition of those who study  economics is to understand the world around them both as it is and as  it ought to be. The basic principles of economics are applied to a wide  range of social and political challenges that confront us today. These  include international trade, environmental protection, health care,  development, domestic taxes, Federal Reserve policies, labor  outsourcing, and the regulation of private business. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> The economics curriculum at St. Olaf includes theory, applications, institutional studies, and quantitative analysis. Where appropriate, economics courses also pursue historical and ethical concerns. </p>
              <p class="body"> The department offers areas of emphasis for its majors who desire more focused study in finance, management, international economics, and public policy. The department also supports several programs available  to students regardless of major: an interdisciplinary concentration in  management studies, the programs of the Finstad Office for  Entrepreneurial Studies, study abroad, and internship opportunities. </p>
              <p class="body"> The  economics major serves as excellent preparation for careers in a wide  variety of fields, including economic analysis, banking, accounting,  consulting, health administration, finance, business management,  teaching, and international affairs. The major also provides a solid  foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in  economics, business, public policy, and law. </p>
