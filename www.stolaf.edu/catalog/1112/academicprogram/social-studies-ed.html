        <p class="body"><em>The purpose of teaching social studies in middle and high school (grades 5-12) is three-fold:  1) to provide middle and high school students a broad foundation in  what is known about human social experience, interaction, and behavior;  2) to provide students with perspectives  that will assist them in understanding self and others; and 3) to  provide students a foundation for appreciating and critically  evaluating claims of knowledge about human social experience,  interaction, and behavior. </em></p>
        <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">Social  studies education is an interdisciplinary major involving seven  disciplines: economics, education, history, geography, political  science, psychology, and sociology/anthropology. It is a necessary  component for a license to teach social studies in middle school and  high school. </span></p>
            <p class="body">The field of social studies education demands reflective practitioners with a broad foundation in the liberal arts and specific knowledge in each of the seven disciplines. The social studies education major equips students with this core content knowledge while also providing multiple opportunities for critical thinking about the various ways we construct knowledge and communicate the human experience. Students may consider a double major with one of the seven disciplines or combine the major with a concentration in American racial and multicultural studies or other interdisciplinary concentration.  Students may graduate with a social studies education major without completing requirements leading to a license to teach (see additional requirements below). </p>
