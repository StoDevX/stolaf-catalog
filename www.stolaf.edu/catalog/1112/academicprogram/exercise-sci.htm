              <p class="programdescription"> Exercise Science is the study of human movement, from its analysis to application in educational  and sport settings. Its aim is the improvement of human performance and  the enhancement of human development through the medium of physical  activity throughout the lifespan. St. Olaf offers an exercise science  major, a variety of activity courses to meet the general education  requirements for graduation, intramural and club sports, and twenty-seven varsity  sports. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
              <p class="body">The  exercise science major at St. Olaf is designed for students interested in the advanced and specialized study of the biophysical aspects of exercise. The major supports academic linkages across the disciplines and provides excellent preparation in a wide variety of fields (such as physical therapy and rehabilitation, biomechanics, nutrition, exercise physiology, sport medicine, chiropractics, cardiac rehabilitation). It is recommended that this major be complemented by other majors or concentrations of interest to the student.</p>
