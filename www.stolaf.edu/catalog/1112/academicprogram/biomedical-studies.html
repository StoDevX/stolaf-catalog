              <p class="programdescription"> Biomedical  studies is a multidisciplinary program offering a contract  concentration that can be earned in conjunction with any B.A. academic  major. The concentration is intended as a plan of study that will  enhance the preparation of students entering careers in the biomedical  arena ranging from medicine to sports science to hospital  administration. The concentration offers students an opportunity for a  broad and thoughtful exposure to biomedical studies. Students  develop a biomedical studies concentration by implementing a plan of  study to match their individual needs. Students must first consult with  the Biomedical Studies Program director and develop a contract anytime between the  end of their first year and the beginning of their junior year. The  contract may be altered by mutual consent at any time. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">overview of the concentration</p>
              <p class="body">With such a variety of careers in health care today, it can be difficult for undergraduate students interested in human health and medicine to find the path that fits them best. The biomedical studies concentration was designed and implemented in 2000 in order to provide students with an academic experience that helps them not only research but also prepare for careers in health care. This concentration includes  course, practical, and experiential requirements which together help the student explore many aspects of potential health careers.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p class="body"> The biomedical studies concentration consists of five courses and non-course experiences. All students must take a foundation course in human biology (Biology 123 or 243, depending on their course of study). In addition,  students are required to choose one course from opportunities in each  of three core components: 1) practical application; 2)  ethical consideration; and 3) level II or III elective outside the student's major. Within each of these three  components, several choices fulfill the requirement.  Seminars and Interim courses may be included as they become available. An experiential learning requirement may be fulfilled by an appropriate course or by a non-course activity. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> PRACTICAL APPLICATION </p>
              <p class="coursename">Course selected must be outside the student's major. </p>

              <p> <span class="body">This  component requires students to arrange a non-classroom experience that  exposes them to a hands-on or immediately present form of biomedical  learning. Off-campus courses, internships or practica in this area  enable the student to observe some area in the biomedical arena.  Students may incorporate many different experiences into their  biomedical contract. Examples include: </span></p>
