              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2011-12:</strong> Anne H. Groton, Greek and Roman drama</span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2011-12:</strong> Christopher M. Brunelle, Latin poetry; Valerio Caldesi-Valeri, Greek historiography; James M. May, Greek and Roman rhetoric (on leave); Steve Reece, Greek and Roman epic</span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Long  ago the Greeks and Romans conceived the idea of the liberal arts and  made them the basis of higher education. Today the Department of  Classics keeps that classical tradition alive at St. Olaf by offering  courses in the languages, literature, and culture of ancient Greece and  Rome. The study of Graeco-Roman civilization gives students perspective on their own place in history while increasing their understanding of the world into which Christianity was born.</span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Many  students satisfy the foreign language requirement with three semesters  of Greek or Latin. Greek is especially helpful for pre-seminary and  pre-medicine students, Latin for pre-law students. Either language makes a good match with the Great Conversation program. </p>
              <p class="body"> <span class="programdescription">Every term the Department of Classics offers at least one course that demands no knowledge  of Greek or Latin and fulfills general education requirements; among  the most popular of these classics courses are </span>Greek and Roman Myth  <span class="programdescription">(Classics 241) and the annual </span>Interim in Greece <span class="programdescription">(Classics 251). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students often combine a major in Greek or Latin with another major. A classical background  enriches one&rsquo;s experiences in college and in later life, while the  verbal and analytical skills acquired by learning classical languages  are of lasting benefit in whatever career one chooses. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJORS </h5>
              <p class="body"> Three  different majors in classical language are available to St. Olaf  students: Greek, Latin, and classics. The classics major combines Greek  and Latin and is the most rigorous. All three majors have as their  objectives competence in classical language at an advanced level,  skill in translating and analyzing classical literature of different genres, and familiarity with classical civilization. Potential Latin teachers  may complete a Latin education major. <a href="ancient-studies.html">Ancient studies</a> and <a href="medieval.html">medieval  studies</a>, two interdisciplinary majors overseen by the Department of  Classics, are described elsewhere in this catalog. </p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-235"></a>235 Medieval Latin</p>
<p>Latin was spoken in one form or another for more than two thousand years. This course focuses

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-252"></a>252 Vergil and Latin Epic</p>
<p>Lord Tennyson called Vergil the "wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of
man."  Students encounter that stately measure when they translate selections from Vergil's three
major poems (<I>Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid</I>). They also engage in spirited discussion of
Homer's influence on Vergil and of Vergil's influence on the literature, art, and music of Western

and longing -- are the focus of this Latin course. Students translate the vivacious verse of
Catullus, Horace, Tibullus, and Ovid and learn to recognize the features that make lyric a
distinctive genre of Latin poetry. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-372"></a>372 Latin Historians</p>
<p>The writings of Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus provide breathtaking views of ancient Rome and
memorable vignettes from the city's colorful history. Extended passages from the historians' works,
read in Latin, form the basis for a survey of Roman historiography and of historical writing in
general.  Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-373"></a>373 Lucretius and Latin Poetry</p>
<p>Lucretius might best be described as a philosophical poet. His <I>De Rerum Natura</I> ("On the
Nature of the Universe") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus
and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating
poem.  Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-374"></a>374 Cicero and Latin Prose</p>

prose style. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-375"></a>375 Latin Drama</p>
<p>Strange things happened on the ancient Roman stage; this course gives students firsthand proof

reading. Students in the course translate selected plays and discuss the evolution of the Roman
theater, staging, and modern interpretations. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent.  Offered every
third year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="latin-377"></a>377 Latin Satire</p>
<p>The Romans claimed that satire was a literary genre of their own creation. Students are able to

prominent Roman satirists such as Horace, Petronius, Martial, and Juvenal. Prerequisite: Latin 231
or equivalent.  Offered every third year.</p>

<p>This course introduces a variety of documents (both literary and artistic) to investigate cultural
interactions between ancient Greece and the East in the first millennium BCE.  By studying the
mythological Trojan War, the Persian War, and Alexander the Great's decade of campaigns,
students consider how the ancient Greeks related to the alien cultures with which they were in
continual contact:  what did it mean to be "Greek" or "barbarian" in the ancient world?  Offered
periodically during Interim. Counts towards ancient studies major.</p>

                            <p class="coursename"><a name="classics-122"></a>122 Ghosts, Funerals, and Ferrymen: Death among the Ancient Greeks</p>
<p>Students receive a grounding in Greek religion and in the variety of approaches used to study the
classical world.  Armed with evidence from art, archaeology, poetry, drama, history, curse tablets,
and religious rites, they explore the Greek view of mortality: What's a good death?  What happens to
the soul afterward?  Can spirits intervene for the living?  Where can you get a decent meal in
Hades, and just how much is the ferryman charging these days? Offered periodically during Interim.
Counts towards ancient studies major.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="classics-126"></a>126 Ancient Comedy: A Funny Thing Happened</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the wild and wacky world of ancient Greek and Roman
comedy. It traces the development of the genre with discussion of how the plays were produced
in antiquity and what influence they exerted on the drama of later centuries. Students read
works by Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence and stage selected scenes.
