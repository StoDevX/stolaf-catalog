        <div>
          <p class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2011-12: </strong>Karen Achberger (German), 20th-century literature, cinema, Austrian literature; Guido Alvarez (Art and Art History), new media; Kathryn Ananda-Owens (Music) piano; Jean E.

          <p class="programdescription">Art, history, cultural studies, and technology come together in the interdisciplinary study of film: text meets sound and image, art meets science, economics meet aesthetics. Film studies addresses the inherently collaborative nature of a medium where directors, cinematographers, editors, actors, musicians, and set designers work together to create works of art. Films invite analysis and evaluation both as self-contained works of art, and as reflections of the historical and cultural circumstances in which they are created and consumed. </p>
          <p class="goldhead">overview of the concentration</p>
          <p class="body">The Film studies concentration  equips students with basic skills of visual literacy (how to &quot;read&quot; the moving image), and the ability to understand the cultural, historical, and commercial contexts of films.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/film.htm" class="goldhead">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE CONCENTRATION</a>          </p>
          <p class="goldhead">requirements for the concentration</p>
          <p class="body">The Film studies concentration consists of five courses, at least three at level II or III, including:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="body">(1) Film Studies 101:<em> Introduction to Film Studies.</em></p>
            <p class="body">(2) Studies in the history, theory, or cultural meaning of film. Two elective courses focus on the history, theory, or cultural expression of film within the United States or in a global context. These courses examine the production, critical evaluation, cultural history, and reception of film. Students take two courses to develop fluency with the critical and theoretical methods of the discipline (see list below).</p>
            <p class="body">(3) Practical film studies. One elective course that focuses on practical aspects of film creation or criticism. These courses emphasize modern film as professional practice, asking students to master at least one of the main creative or technical skill sets used in film-making (see list below).</p>
            <p class="body">(4) Integrative film studies. One more elective class drawn from (2) and (3) above, or an integrative film topics course approved by the program (see list below), or a contract course worked out in consultation with the program director and the instructor. This course challenges students to synthesize their previous study of film in ways consistent with their own needs and interests, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of film studies. Students must present to the program director a brief explanation of how their work in this course synthesizes previous interests.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="body">Note: no more than one course from another institution may count toward the concentration.</p>
          <p class="coursename">Film Studies 101 Introduction to Film Studies</p>
          <p class="body">This course provides an overview of film studies by focusing on three areas: history of film, production (the basic tools of film-making), and theory (the basic vocabulary of film analysis). Students develop visual literacy through engagement with the primary structures, methods, practitioners, history, ideas, and vocabularies of film studies.
            <p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-210"></a>210 Filmmakers/Film Theorists</p>
<p>What is the relationship between film criticism and fimmaking? How is analysis a critical practice
that informs the art and craft of filmmaking? In Filmmakers/Film Theorists we will consider these
questions by focusing on film artists who also write film criticism or theory. Some case studies
that may be explored include: the American, Soviet, and French avant-garde; the European New
Waves; the Dogme '95 collective; and filmmakers Pier Paolo Pasolini, Agnes Varda, and
Robert Bresson. Prerequisite: Film 101 or permission of instructor.</p>
