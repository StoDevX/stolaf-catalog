              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2011-12:</strong> Deborah J. Anderson, clinical and health psychology (fall semester only);   Grace Cho, developmental psychology;  Shelly Dickinson, conditioning and learning, behavioral neuroscience; Christopher Fischer, industrial and organizational psychology; Dana Gross, developmental psychology;    Charles W.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  Department of Psychology is committed to maintaining a rigorous  academic curriculum within a supportive community structure. It seeks  to address broad questions posed by a liberal education and specific concerns of individual students. St. Olaf College&rsquo;s mission statement  provides a framework for curriculum, personal development, and  community relations. Because life is more than facts and theories, the  Psychology Department encourages students to be &ldquo;responsible citizens  dedicated to service,&rdquo; as well as scientific &ldquo;seekers of truth.&rdquo; </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Psychology courses contribute to general education by fulfilling both foundation studies  (ORC and WRI) and core studies (HBS, EIN, IST and SED, MCD, MCG). They  introduce the disciplinary knowledge that nurtures growth and  behavioral change while providing background for advanced study.  Psychology contributes to majors in social work and nursing, to concentrations in   environmental studies, family studies, Asian studies, linguistic studies, neuroscience, and  women&rsquo;s studies, and to the psychology core of the social studies  education major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Psychology  majors are prepared for graduate and professional programs in  psychology, medicine, law, physical therapy, social work, nursing, and  ministry and for entering positions in business, government, or  industry. </p>

<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The Department of Psychology follows the American Psychological Association&rsquo;s guidelines of &ldquo;synthesizing  the natural and social science aspects of the discipline, in part, by  requiring students to take courses in both knowledge bases.&rdquo; Thus both  interpersonal and investigative skills are enhanced. Students benefit  from research in the library, laboratory, and field, as well as from  internships. Through course structure and faculty diversity, the  department challenges students to think critically and creatively as  they investigate  ways in which animals, especially humans, adapt to their environment  through biological, social, emotional, spiritual, perceptual,  behavioral, linguistic, and cognitive processes. </p>

unique theoretical perspectives, skills, and methodological approaches that psychologists use
to address social problems and community needs through research, practice, and policy.
Students' on-site experiences and observations provide opportunities for the application of
previous coursework as well as guided reflection and exploration of goals for personal and
vocational development. Prerequisite: Psychology 130. Offered periodically.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-225"></a>225 Psychophysiology</p>
<p>Learn to use methods of 21st-century neuroscience to study current questions about mind-body
relationships.  Psychophysiology, an area of cognitive neuroscience, reveals new insights about
cognition and emotions by measuring accompanying changes in physiological activity such as brain
waves, heart activity, and facial muscle movements.  Students work in teams to gain hands-on
laboratory experience and training in principles and techniques of electro-encephalography,
electro-cardiology, and electromyography.  Prerequisite: Psychology 125.  Offered during Interim.
Counts toward biomedical studies and neuroscience concentrations.</p>

<p class="coursename">Asian Studies/Psychology 226: Human Development in East  Asia: Perspectives from China  and Japan</p>
<p class="body">Students reflect on their own culture as they explore  childhood and family life in China  and Japan.  Developmental and cross-cultural research, memoirs, works of fiction, and films  are used to study parents' beliefs and childrearing practices as well as the  development of the self, peer relationships, school achievement, and role  changes during adulthood. With life expectancy increasing around the world,  students also discover how China  and Japan  are responding to the graying of their populations. Prerequisites: Psychology  125 or Asian Studies 121. Offered during Interim.</p>
<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-227"></a>227 Environmental Psychology at Rocky Mountain National Park</p>
<p>This course investigates the human relationship with the natural world, examining ways in which the
natural environment is important psychologically to human beings.  Integrating aspects of
theoretical and empirical psychology, environmental studies and literature, we explore meanings,
values, and questions such as: How are we affected by nature?  What affects people's attitudes
and behaviors toward the environment?  How do we respond to environmental challenges?  How
does the field of psychology address the natural world?  Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or
Environmental Studies 137.  Offered during Interim. Counts towards American studies major.
Counts toward environmental studies major (all tracks) and concentration.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-230"></a>230 Research Methods in Psychology</p>
<p>This course prepares the student with tools for understanding how research studies in psychology
are conceptualized, designed, carried out, interpreted, and disseminated to the public. Use of
library and Internet resources, ethical guidelines in the conduct of research and the skills of
good scientific writing are emphasized. Students work independently and in small groups to
design and conduct their own research projects. Prerequisites: Psych 125; Statistics 110 or 212
or 263; Psych 130 is recommended. Offered each semester. Counts toward environmental
studies major (social science track) and statistics concentration.</p>

tenderness and pain, perceptions of movement, pitch, symmetry, and color. Students participate
actively in psychophysical, physiological, and perceptual laboratories and classes on vision,
audition, somesthesis, and the chemical senses.  The course includes lecture and laboratory work.
Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or Neuroscience 234.  Offered annually. Counts toward
neuroscience concentration.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-236"></a>236 Conditioning and Learning</p>
<p>How do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning process? While some
emphasis is on analysis of the behavioral viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students also examine
the ways current investigators apply these basic principles to problems in other fields.  These
include behavioral therapy for a variety of psychological disturbances, research on the
neurobiology of drug reward, and analysis of consumer behavior.  The course includes lecture
and laboratory work with nonhuman animals.  Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or Biology 125.  Offered
annually. Counts toward neuroscience concentration.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-237"></a>237 Cognition, Learning and Memory</p>

Statistics 110, 212 or 263.  Offered annually. Counts toward neuroscience concentration.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-238"></a>238 Biopsychology</p>
<p>How do biological factors influence fundamental aspects of psychology and behavior?  In this course,

physiological, and biochemical levels of analysis to understand basic behavioral processes and
systems, including sensation, movement, emotion, sleep and arousal, hunger, motivation, learning,
and psychopathology.  Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or Biology 123 or 125. Offered each
semester. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="psych-241"></a>241 Developmental Psychology</p>

human development. Major changes in physical, cognitive, personality and social development are
discussed.  Prerequisite: Psychology 125.  Offered each semester. Counts toward nursing and
social work majors and educational studies and family studies concentrations.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="psych-244"></a>244 Psychology of Personality</p>
<p>Students examine theories of normal personality development in an effort to understand the factors
that shape personality. Is personality biologically determined? Is it a result of interpersonal
experiences, learning and reinforcement? Are other factors involved as well? Students investigate
