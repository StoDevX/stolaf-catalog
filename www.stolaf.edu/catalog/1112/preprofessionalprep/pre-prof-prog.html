            <p class="programname">Pre-Professional Programs</p>
        <p class="body">The following roster of pre-professional studies indicates how the liberal arts can fulfill the general as well as the specialized objectives of St. Olaf students. Recommendations are based on the typical pre-professional requirements currently existing in universities and professional schools. </p>
            <p class="body">Many other occupations beyond those in this roster may be pursued with a liberal arts background, of course. To learn more about them, call or visit the campus contact persons listed in areas that seem similar. </p>
            <p class="body">Subjects grouped under the headings &ldquo;Strongly Recommended&rdquo; are required by many institutions while those under &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; are important but not necessarily required. Because of their diverse nature, many professions such as business and management, law, and public policy defy course-specific recommendations for undergraduates. For example, as many psychology as economics majors in the United States enter business careers each year through corporate training programs. In those instances, recommendations should be considered suggestive, not directive. Opposite examples are <a href="../academicprogram/nursing.html">nursing</a> and <a href="../academicprogram/social-work.html">social work</a>, which have prescribed curriculums required for licensure examinations. </p>
        <p class="body">Students are encouraged to work closely with faculty, pre-professional advisors, department chairs, and the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Piper Center for Vocation and Career</a> during and after their time at St. Olaf. </p>

        <p class="body">Students planning to sit for the CPA examination upon graduation should major in economics or mathematics and take elective courses in accounting and finance. Since 2000, new members of the American Institute of CPAs have been required to earn one year of college credit beyond the bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students are strongly advised to check the regulations for licensure in the state where they intend to practice. </p>
            <p align="left" class="body"><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> Management Studies 225, 237, 250, 251, 252, 281, and 380; Mathematics 126 </p>

            <p class="body">Career paths in architecture include graduate professional programs toward becoming a licensed architect, teaching architecture and/or architectural history, and involvement in many fields of design, from environmental work, urban design, and landscape architecture, to interior and furnishings design. A studio art major and courses in art and architectural history are recommended. Because architecture requires a comprehensive understanding of culture, it is important to have a background in municipal organization, literature, writing and presenting ideas, aesthetics, logical and ethical problem solving, collaborative work and research, and environmental sustainability, as well as in mathematics and physics.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> A major in the visual arts with an emphasis in sculpture, painting, architectural drawing, and digital media (Art 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 228, and 239); a strong background in art history; and strong background in mathematics (Calculus I and II and Physics 124L and 125L). </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Recommended: </strong>Courses in American and European history, American and/or urban studies, literature (especially with advanced writing components), and philosophy; social science courses; and at least one ORC-designated course </p>

            <p class="body">Students planning to enter the business world immediately upon graduation and seek a career in accounting, finance, management, or marketing should major in economics and consider an area of emphasis, or they should consider a management studies concentration combined with a major other than economics.</p>

        <p class="body">The best Masters of Business Administration (MBA) programs do not require a specific undergraduate curriculum.

            <p class="body">Computer science remains at the heart of preparation for careers or graduate study in computer engineering (which focuses on hardware design) and software engineering, since computer science provides a conceptual foundation for computing disciplines. The emphasis on &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; learning techniques, professionalism, and computing ethics and on the development of communication and leadership skills in St. Olaf&rsquo;s computer science major program give a further preparatory boost to future engineers. The following courses are particularly recommended. </p>

A cooperative program exists that enables a student to receive a B.A. degree from St. Olaf and a B.S. degree in engineering from either Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., or the University of Minnesota, in a five-year program.

            <p class="body"><strong>Recommended:</strong> Courses in political science and economics are most directly applicable and are strongly rec-ommended. However, a broad liberal arts education also provides strong preparation. Courses in all disciplines can offer unique perspectives on public policy issues and excellent training for a career in public service. </p>
            <p class="body">Students with an interest in an international career (such as the Foreign Service) should, in addition to courses recommended above, pursue advanced foreign language studies. </p>
