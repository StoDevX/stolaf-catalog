            <p class="programname">Academic Resources</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Academic Advising CENTER</p>
            <p class="programdescription">Academic advising at St. Olaf College encourages the integration of the mind, body, and spirit as students learn to create academic, career, and lifelong goals. Students discover how to direct their intellectual curiosity, to overcome personal or academic barriers to learning, and to pursue their goals. Central to this educational process is the collaboration between students and their faculty advisors. </p>
            <p class="subhead">Advisors</p>
            <p class="body">The <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/aac/">Academic Advising Center</a> assigns a faculty advisor to each student. After completing at least one semester, all students may change to a different faculty advisor at any time during the academic year, with the permission of the new advisor via a change of advisor form. The Academic Advising Center and the department chairs and program directors oversee the reassignment of advisees for faculty on sabbaticals or other leaves. Generally speaking, no individual faculty member has more than 25 to 30 advisees in any given year.</p>
            <p class="body">The advice of faculty advisors does not constitute a promise or a contract ensuring a student&rsquo;s graduation on schedule or the completion of specific requirements. Students and faculty advisors must refer to the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">class and lab schedules</a> to determine which courses fulfill specific graduation requirements. The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student. Students have access to their academic records at any time on St. Olaf&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/sis">Student Information System (S.I.S</a>). </p>
            <p class="subhead">Goals for Academic Advising </p>

            <p class="subhead">Academic Peer Advisors (APA)</p>
            <p class="body">Academic Peer Advisors are a select group of current St. Olaf College students who assist the Academic Advising Center in providing quality, timely service on routine and general academic curricular questions. They enable their peers to become more knowledgeable and involved in planning their academic programs. Academic Peer Advisors also assist with academic planning sessions during Week One (new student orientation), set up academic planning sessions during the year, provide support during registration times, and assist the Coordinator of the Academic Advising Center as needed.</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="body">All ASC services are free of charge for full-time St. Olaf students. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Student Disability Services</p>
        <p class="body">Student Disability Services is the designated office on the St. Olaf College campus that verifies and is the custodian of student disability documentation, establishes reasonable accommodations, and acts as a resource/advocate for students with disabilities.

        <p class="body">Student Disability Services seeks to provide to students with disabilities equal access to academic information through accommodations and support and to inform  the  college community about disability issues. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">Piper Center for Vocation and Career</p>
        <p class="body"> The <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Piper Center</a> is comprised of four umbrella programs offering a host of opportunities to gain experience while pursuing an undergraduate degree. Within each program are initiatives that promote the CEL&rsquo;s mission to &ldquo;create and facilitate experiential learning that complements the St. Olaf curriculum.&rdquo; In addition, the CEL is a resource center for students, providing information and assistance to help determine vocational goals and devise well-informed post-graduation plans. </p>
        <p class="body"><strong><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Career Connections</a></strong> &mdash; The Career Connections program helps students develop, implement, and evaluate career/life plans and collaborates with academic departments to integrate concepts of career development into courses of study. The career connections process emphasizes career exploration, experiential learning, and reflection through a wide range of assessments, resources, services, and programs throughout the campus community. </p>
        <p align="left"> <span class="body"><strong> <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Academic Internships </a></strong> &mdash; The  services and resources available through the Academic Internship program support students as they seek to apply their classroom learning to structured educational work experiences. The program staff works closely with academic departments to facilitate internships that offer a high level of correlation between conceptual knowledge and application, and offers tools and strategies that encourage students to set learning goals for and derive meaning from their internship experiences.</span></p>
        <p class="body"><strong><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Entrepreneurship</a></strong> &mdash; The  Entrepreneurship program promotes social innovation and entrepreneurship among students, faculty, and alumni. Dedicated to education, research, and service within the liberal arts, the program supports a community of people actively engaged in social innovation and entrepreneurship through a selective  Innovation Scholars program, grants, courses, internships, and special events. </p>
        <p class="body"><strong> <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Civic Engagement</a></strong> &mdash; The Civic Engagement program broadens academic experiences by linking students and faculty with civic engagement and service opportunities in local, national and international contexts. Collaborations between the CEL, faculty members, and community partners enhance learning and encourage students to develop the skills, knowledge and experience necessary for engaged and responsible citizenship.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Information and Instructional
          Technologies</p>
        <p class="body">Information and Instructional Technologies (IIT) provides computers, software, A/V technologies, and support services to the entire St. Olaf community. All campus computers &mdash; including Macintoshes, PCs, and Linux-based systems &mdash; connect to a campus network that provides free access to e-mail, software servers, electronic storage spaces, the Internet, and Internet 2. </p>
        <p class="body">Public labs are located in all the academic buildings and residence halls and provide equal access to equipment and software for all students, whether or not they are enrolled in a course requiring the use of the computer. In addition to the public facilities, 19 departments share or have their own specialized computing labs. This brings the total number of computers available for student use to more than 800, or a student-computer ratio of just under 4:1. Multimedia editing facilities are also available and used heavily. </p>
        <p class="body">Computing use is not limited to out-of-class assignments as nearly all of the St. Olaf faculty rely on some form of computing technology in their teaching, e-mail notifications or discussions and use of Moodle &mdash; the campus course management system &mdash; being the most popular. All college classrooms are equipped with appropriate technologies and are updated or added to each year. </p>
        <p class="body">Over 97 percent of all students have their own computer on campus; many also have their own printer. Students who own a computer can connect to the campus network and the Internet in their own rooms in all of the eleven residence halls, using either the wireless network or a wired connection. Wireless access is  available across campus, including many outdoor spaces. Students can access their course assignments, check e-mail, review their grades, view their tuition bills, or just surf the Web from the comfort of their rooms or from a study space in the library or other academic building. </p>
        <p class="body">IIT employs 22 full-time professionals and nearly 70 student employees who support the computing needs of the entire campus &mdash; students, staff, and faculty. A campus help desk and student computing consultants are available nearly 95 hours per week during the academic year, including assistance in the evenings. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">St. Olaf&rsquo;s Libraries and Special Collections</p>
        <p class="body">The 2008 Princeton review rated the St. Olaf library as the ninth best college or university library in the nation. Together, the St. Olaf and Carleton libraries and Information and Instructional Technologies provide a variety of carefully selected resources that  mirror the breadth and depth of the undergraduate curriculum. The partnership between the libraries and Information and Instructional Technologies provides access to regional, national, and international networks, databases, and other sources of information and ensures the availability of academic resources to the entire community. </p>
        <p class="body">Twenty-six  staff and more than 100 students  purchase, organize, and make available a rich blend of materials and access points. The Bridge consortium of St. Olaf and Carleton College library collections contains over 1.3 million  items, including videos,  sound recordings, software, microforms, and many electronic resources. The St. Olaf portion of this collection is  housed in three separate libraries: R&oslash;lvaag  Library (the &ldquo;main&rdquo; library), Halvorson Music Library, and  Hustad Science Library. The libraries subscribe to thousands of print and electronic periodicals and are  a partial depository for federal government publications.</p>
        <p class="body"> While the Bridge consortium provides the fundamental resources for undergraduate research, it also has a number of unusual strengths. St. Olaf, for example, has  especially strong holdings in the fields of religion, Scandinavian literature and history, mathematics, and music. St. Olaf is also one of the few places where extensive materials can be found for the study of the culture and church life of Norwegian Americans. The St. Olaf Libraries digitize and make freely available unique local publications such as the Manitou Messenger, the Viking Yearbook, and other works of historical significance to St. Olaf.</p>
        <p> <span class="body">Strong consortial relationships  with libraries throughout the United States ensure the availability of materials necessary for virtually all types of research. </span></p>
        <p class="body">The St. Olaf Libraries are distinguished by an instruction program that teaches students to conduct research in the disciplines taught at St. Olaf. Librarians work with specific assignments in classes and provide research assistance at the reference desks in all three libraries. The libraries are open 110 hours per week when class is in session, with extended hours late in the semester and during exams. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Kierkegaard Library</p>
        <p class="body">The Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library, located within the R&oslash;lvaag Library building, is  the major research collection outside of Denmark for the study of the thought of the Danish philosopher, S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard. The library was presented to St. Olaf College in 1976 by the Hongs, who gathered the collection to support their translation into English of the complete works of Kierkegaard, published in 26 volumes by Princeton University Press. The Library is directed by Professor Gordon Marino, a Kierkegaard specialist and professor in the Philosophy Department. Especially during the summer, the library offers programs that bring students and visiting scholars together for research seminars and private study as well as study of Danish for the purpose of reading Kierkegaard texts in the original language. More than 50 scholars a year come to the Library from all over the U.S. and around the world. The collection includes 11,000 book volumes as well as 4,000 periodical and newspaper articles, non-print media, and archival materials. The collection is open Monday-Friday 9:00 a.m-5:00 p.m.  during the academic year, with extended hours in the summer months. Access to the collection at other times is available by appointment. The collection is open to anyone with interest in the study of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard, including St. Olaf and Carleton students, faculty, scholars, pastors, and other visitors.

        <p class="subhead">College Archives</p>
        <p class="body">Located in the R&oslash;lvaag Library Building, the Shaw-Olson Center for College History contains official records and publications, private papers, photographs, books, periodicals, audio and visual recordings, and museum artifacts that record and illustrate the history and life of the college. These materials provide historical information about the Board of Regents, the faculty, the student body, alumni, academic departments, the curriculum, administrative offices, campus services, college organizations, and campus activities. The mission of the archives is 1) to preserve materials that reflect the college&rsquo;s identity; 2) to make these materials available to scholars, students, alumni, and other interested researchers; and 3) to promote attention to the college's history. The collection may be searched electronically with <em>Fram</em> at <a href="http://fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/">http://fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/</a>. <em>Fram</em> identifies paper records and artifacts, indexes abstracts of all articles in the student newspaper, <em><a href="http://fusion.stolaf.edu/messenger/">The Manitou Messenger</a></em>, and provides full text searching for the St. Olaf magazine. The Center for College History  also provides work  opportunities for some students and occasional internships for majors in appropriate departments and programs. </p>
        <p class="subhead">The Norwegian-American Historical Association</p>
        <p class="body">Housed in the R&oslash;lvaag Library Building, the Norwegian-American Historical Association (NAHA) has been sheltered by St. Olaf since its founding in 1925. With an international membership of nearly 2,000, NAHA has two goals: to publish scholarly books on Norwegian-American history (90 books have been published so far) and to be a national center for research in Norwegian-American history by collecting and maintaining printed and manuscript materials produced by Norwegian-Americans or concerning their history. Printed materials are incorporated in the college library collection and other materials (such as diaries, journals, newspapers, periodicals, and records of organizations) in a separate archive. The oldest, out of print publications are available on the NAHA website at: <em><a href="http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/">www.naha.stolaf.edu</a>. </em>Both students and the public are invited to use this center for research in Norwegian migration. </p>

        <p class="goldhead">Student Support Services</p>
        <p class="body">The St. Olaf College Student Support Services (SSS) program is a  college retention program funded by the U.S. Department of Education, St.  Olaf College,  the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the North Star STEM Alliance. The SSS  program is one of three TRIO programs originally funded under the Higher  Education Act of 1965, whose objective is to help students overcome class,  social, and cultural barriers to complete their college education. SSS provides  the following services: academic advising/referral; cultural events and  leadership activities; financial aid advising; graduate school preparation;  incentive program for academic achievement; research, internship and  scholarship application assistance; supplemental instruction (SI); and a  graphing calculator lending program. </p>
        <p class="body">To be eligible for services, a participant must be a first-generation college student (neither parent has a four-year degree),  meet federal income guidelines, and/or have a documented disability. The SSS program provides services to approximately 160 eligible St. Olaf students annually. In order to apply for the program, students should contact Student Support Services, 507-786-8018. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">Other ACADEMIC support</p>
        <p class="subhead"> Class Attendance</p>
        <p class="body">Class attendance is expected and usually required. Irregular class attendance becomes the concern of the college since absence from class represents an academic loss. Excessive or prolonged absences are reported by instructors to the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/deanofstudents/">Dean of Students Office</a>. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Study Time and Study Habits</p>
        <p class="body">Many students need to adjust their time use habits on arrival at college. St. Olaf students report spending, on average, two to three hours of study outside of class for each hour in class. Making the best use of the limited time available usually requires using a good mix of daylight and evening hours for studying and avoiding study marathons. Successful study at St. Olaf usually includes reading ahead, attending class, using faculty office hours, studying for each class in frequent, short study sessions, attending help sessions, forming a study group, asking questions soon after they arise, and seeking help if the preceding efforts do not appear to be working. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Faculty Office Hours</p>
        <p class="body">Professors hold office hours for the classes they teach. Office hours are regular times set aside each week to talk with students from class, usually on a walk-in basis. Office hours provide an opportunity to ask questions about class topics, to extend the class discussion, or to get to know instructors better. St. Olaf faculty encourage students to avail themselves of this opportunity. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Help Sessions</p>
        <p class="body">Many departments hold special help sessions or discussion groups for particular courses. These are usually listed on syllabi for those courses and are usually staffed with upperclass students who have been successful in the course. These sessions may offer an opportunity to get a second look at the class material, to rehearse the ideas and vocabulary, and to ask questions. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Study Groups</p>
        <p class="body">Most students find it helpful in at least some of their courses to form a study group of two to three interested classmates. Such groups often improve understanding of course material through discussing assignments, exploring course ideas further, brainstorming possible test questions for each other or formulating questions to bring up in class. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Continuous Reporting System</p>
        <p class="body">Instructors are required to file a continuous reporting form that alerts the  Dean of Students Office to students who are having difficulties in a course. </p>
