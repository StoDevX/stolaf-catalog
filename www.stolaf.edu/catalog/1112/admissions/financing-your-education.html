            <p class="body">Full-time students who take more than 4.50 courses in any semester will be charged 50% of the same academic year&rsquo;s quarter-credit tuition charge per quarter-credit overload. </p>
            <p class="body">Above and beyond the tuition, including possible overload charge, additional costs should be anticipated for books, private lessons in music, and special courses, including study skills and off-campus programs. (See ADDITIONAL COSTS AND FEES below for detailed information.) </p>
            <p class="body">St. Olaf aims to maintain all published charges throughout the school year, but reserves the right to make adjustments and change procedures should unforeseen conditions make it necessary. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">Payment Options</p>
            <p class="body"><strong> Semester Payment Plan:</strong> Students pay in two installments. The first semester payment is due on August 26, 2011; the second semester payment is due on January 20, 2012. If payments are not made on time, a finance charge of .5% a month is assessed on the unpaid balance. </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Single Payment Plan:</strong> After the prepayment of $600 is received, a single payment of $45,950 by August 26, 2011, will yield a $400 discount on the $46,950 comprehensive fee. The discount is not available to students receiving need-based financial aid. The discount is pro-rated for merit scholarship recipients and for students who receive non-need-based loans. </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Monthly Payment Plan:</strong> Ten equal payments on the balance due (after financial aid and $600 prepayment) beginning July 15. Students enrolling in this plan after July 15 may double or triple the first payment to catch up on missed payments. Participation fee of $65. </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Quarterly Payment Plan:</strong> Four equal payments on the balance due (after financial aid and $600 prepayment) beginning July 15 and continuing on September 15, December 15, and March 15. Participation fee of $65. </p>
        <p class="body">The monthly and quarterly payment plans are administered by <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/stuacct/pmtplan.htm">Tuition Management Systems</a> (TMS). Both the monthly and quarterly payment plans permit families to finance an amount up to the comprehensive fee minus any financial aid awarded by the college. No finance charge will be assessed on monthly or quarterly plans as long as payments are current. TMS offers a life insurance feature for participants. </p>
        <p class="body">St. Olaf is also accepting ACH and credit card payments for tuition bills. Payments made with   ACH or credit card are only accepted online and cannot by paid over the phone or at the Business Office window. In order to pay the bill online the student must log into the <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/sis/login.cfm">Student Information System (SIS)</a>. From the Financials Section of the SIS, you will find the links necessary to pay via ACH or credit card. In order for someone other than the student to access the Financials page and pay online through the SIS, that person must be signed up for e-bill. Please <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/stuacct/e-bill.html">click here</a> for more information regarding e-bill.</p>
        <p class="body">For more information contact: The Student Accounts Office, 1520 St. Olaf Avenue, St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN 55057-1098, Tel: 507-786-3296 or 866-640-4702 or contact TMS directly at 800-356-8329. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">PAYMENT SCHEDULE FOR 2011-12</p>
            <p class="body">The comprehensive fee is regarded as an annual charge rather than the sum of charges for each term. Payments for the 2011-12 academic year are due as follows: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body">$600: Returning student payment due on or before March 11, 2011 <br />

            </blockquote>
            <p class="goldhead">ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR 2012-13</p>
            <p class="body"> <b>New Students, $600: </b>Accepted applicants for admission to St. Olaf College will receive notice of an initial payment of $300 to be paid on or before May 1, 2012. An additional payment of $300 will be due on or before June 1, 2012. The total of $600 will be credited to the September 2012 comprehensive fee and is not transferable or refundable. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Returning Students, $300: </b>All returning students are required to make a reservation payment of $300 on or before March 9, 2012, to indicate their intention to re-enroll at St. Olaf in September 2012. Only those who have made this payment by the March 9, 2012 deadline are eligible for room draw and registration appointments in April. This payment will be accepted by the Business Office only on settled accounts. </p>
            <p class="body">The $300 reservation payment will be credited to the September 2012 comprehensive fee and is not transferable. It is subject to the following refund schedule, if intent to withdraw from St. Olaf is communicated to the Office of the Dean of Students: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body"> On or before April 1, 2012: $300 <br />
              On or before May 1, 2012: $225 <br />
              On or before June 1, 2012: $150 <br />

              After July 1, 2012: $0 <br />
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body">As an exception, the $300 reservation payment is fully refundable for those students who do all of the following: </p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">File a <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> prior to April 15, 2012, and</li>
              <li class="body">Determine the financial aid award offered is not sufficient to permit re-enrollment at St. Olaf, and</li>
              <li class="body">Notify the Office of the Dean of Students prior to June 1, 2012, or within two weeks of receiving their financial aid award, that they will not be re-enrolling at St. Olaf in September 2012. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="goldhead"><a name="addfees" id="addfees"></a>ADDITIONAL FEES AND COSTS </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Books and Supplies</b> &mdash; $1000 average per year depending on course of study. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Fees for Private Music Lessons </b>&mdash; $425 (in addition to tuition charge). One 30-minute lesson per week, per semester, in voice, piano, organ, or orchestral or band instruments. If a student drops a private music lesson after the beginning of classes for that term (sixth day of the semester), there is no refund of the lesson fee. If a student's schedule with overload includes a music lesson,  both the music lesson fee and the overload tuition charge are required.</p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Heath Insurance </strong>&mdash; $856 for the 2011-12 academic year. St. Olaf requires that all students enrolled at the College have health insurance. If students are not covered under a comparable health insurance policy, they will be expected to participate in the Student Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan offered through USI Affinity Collegiate Insurance Resources. If a student has health insurance and does not wish to participate in the insurance offered through St. Olaf they must complete a waiver form online. This waiver must be completed each year they are enrolled at St. Olaf. If not completed prior to the 10th day of classes a non-refundable $856 will be added to the students tuition account.</p>
            <p class="body"><b>Other Tuition Charges</b> &mdash; Students who are permitted to register for fewer than three courses are known as part-time students and will be charged at the following rates: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body"> Per full course: $4,770 <br />
                Per half course: $2,390<br />
              Per quarter course: $1,195</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body"><strong>Overload Charge</strong> &mdash; 50% of the same academic year&rsquo;s quarter-credit tuition charge per quarter-credit overload.  If a student's schedule with overload includes a music lesson,  both the music lesson fee and the overload tuition charge are required.</p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Handling Fee</strong> &mdash; $50. This fee assigned to cover expenses pertaining to late registrations, changes in registration, and special petitions accepted by the registrar. </p>
            <p class="body"><strong><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/transcriptorderinfo.html">Transcript Fee</a></strong> &mdash; Official transcripts are $5 each, paid in advance. Rush fee: $10.00</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Finance Charge</strong> &mdash; .5% of unpaid balance/accumulated monthly. </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Off-campus Nursing Program Costs</strong> &mdash; Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts Nursing program must pay costs of immunizations, CPR certification, transportation to clinical sites per college policy, parking, uniforms, the college nursing pin, and a fee is assessed annually for program costs. </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Other Off-campus Programs</strong> &mdash; Many programs off campus involve additional costs beyond the comprehensive fee. Consult the appropriate office or program advisor for details. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">POST GRADUATE STUDIES TUITION REDUCTIONS </p>
            <p class="body">Graduates who wish to pursue nursing, student teaching, a second major or other additional coursework may qualify for a reduced tuition. Consult the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/">Registrar's Office</a> for more information. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNT </p>
            <p class="body">All accounts are expected to be paid according to the schedule noted above. Any variation from this schedule shall be arranged with Student Accounts. </p>
            <p class="body">On accounts carried beyond September 30 for first semester amounts due, and beyond February 28 for second semester amounts due, a finance charge of .5% per month (equivalent to a 6% annual rate) will be added. </p>
            <p class="body">No student is permitted to register if the account for a preceding semester has not been paid in full. </p>
            <p class="body">Money due a student from loans or scholarships is applied on the student&rsquo;s account and is not given in cash unless the account is paid in full. Work earnings are credited to the student&rsquo;s tuition account or bank account. The amount credited is based on the actual hours worked less taxes. Students working the full work award and applying the earnings to their tuition account may deduct the estimated amount of the semester earnings from the balance due.</p>
            <p class="body">The college reserves the right to withhold statements of honorable dismissal, transcripts of courses and grades, or diplomas until all college bills have been paid, or until satisfactory arrangements have been made. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">REFUND POLICY </p>
            <p class="body">Tuition, room, board, and fees refunds for anyone leaving within five weeks after the beginning date of any semester will be determined according to the following graduated scale: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body"> One week or less &#8212; 90% refund <br />
                Two weeks or less &#8212; 80% refund <br />
                Three weeks or less &#8212; 60% refund <br />
                Four weeks or less &#8212; 40% refund <br />
                Five weeks or less &#8212; 20% refund <br />
              Over five weeks &#8212; No refund </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body">After five weeks, no refunds will be made on tuition. Room and board refunds will be pro-rated based on the number of weeks of attendance. Students who withdraw for medical reasons may receive a pro-rated refund of tuition throughout the semester and may be asked to provide the Dean of Students Office with documentation from a health-care provider. </p>
            <p class="body">Refund of Interim room and board in case of withdrawal will be calculated on a similar basis with two days of an Interim equivalent to one week of a semester. In those cases where a change is made in courses involving a charge, the above scale will also apply. No refunds in fees will be made for absences from private lessons, except on account of illness of more than two weeks&rsquo; duration. </p>
            <p class="body">Students dismissed because of unsatisfactory work or infringement of college rules will receive refunds as determined by the administration. </p>
            <p class="body">Students who enroll for the academic year but who elect to omit an Interim are not eligible for tuition or room credit/refund for the Interim. They may apply for an Interim board refund. Refunds will not be given for absences of less than seven consecutive days. The board refund request form (available in the Student Accounts Office) must be filed by the student before he or she leaves for Interim. If not filled out at that time, no refund will be given. </p>
            <p class="body">Students who attend St. Olaf for fall semester only, fall semester and Interim only, Interim and spring semester only, or spring semester only will be charged half of the annual tuition. Room and board will be prorated to reflect the partial-year enrollment. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">The Withdrawal Process</p>
            <p class="body">In order to begin the withdrawal process, a student must contact the Dean of Students Office (verbally or in writing) to begin the paperwork necessary to withdraw or take a leave of absence from St. Olaf. For the purposes of tuition refunds and financial aid refunds, the date of withdrawal is established as the date the student notifies the Dean of Students Office of his/her plans to withdraw. Room and board refunds are based on when the student moves off campus. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Federal Financial Aid Refunds</p>
            <p class="body">If the student is the recipient of Federal Title IV funds (i.e., Federal Pell,  SEOG or TEACH grants or Perkins, Direct Stafford or PLUS loans) and withdraws from the college before completing 60% of the term, federal regulations require St. Olaf to complete a Return of Title IV Calculation to determine the percentage of Title IV funds to be returned to the federal government. The percentage of Title IV aid to be returned is equal to the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar days in the semester. Scheduled breaks of more than five consecutive days are excluded. </p>
        <p class="body">If any funds are to be returned after the return of Title IV aid, they will be used to repay St. Olaf funds, state funds, other private sources, and the student in proportion to the amount received from each non-federal source, as long as there was no unpaid balance at the time of withdrawal. If there was an unpaid balance, then all aid sources will be repaid before any funds are returned to the student. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Institutional Financial Aid Refunds</p>
            <p class="body">If a student is receiving only St. Olaf gift funds, the amount of reduction of the scholarship and grant funds will be pro-rated, reflecting the percentage of the tuition refunded. For example, if 40% of the tuition is refunded, 40% of scholarships and grants will be refunded. </p>
