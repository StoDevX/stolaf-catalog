            <p class="programname">The History and Heritage of St. Olaf </p>
            <p class="body">A group of pioneer pastors, farmers and businessmen
              in Rice, Dakota and Goodhue counties, under the leadership of the
              Rev. Bernt Julius Muus, the Rev. N.A. Quammen and Harald Thorson,
              laid the groundwork for the college's founding in 1874. The
              purpose of the school, then as now, was to offer a program
              of liberal studies to students preparing for careers in business,
              politics, the clergy and other professions. </p>
            <p class="body"> In choosing a name for the institution, the founders
              responded to strong Norwegian national as well as religious symbolism;
              it grew out of a celebration in the Norwegian immigrant community
              of the splendor of the Nordic middle ages as a means of defining
              ethnic merits and identity. They named the school for Olav II Haraldsson
              (spelled Olaf in the 19th century), king of Norway from 1016 until
              1030. His martyrdom on July 29, 1030, at the Battle of Stiklestad,
              close to Pastor Muus's own place of birth, made him Norway's patron
              saint and eternal king and secured a national monarchy and the
              position of the Christian church in that country. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf's School was operated as an academy until
              1886, when a college department was added. The name was changed
              to St. Olaf College in 1889. The first college class graduated
              in 1890. The academy was discontinued in 1917. </p>
            <p class="body"> Affiliated with the Lutheran Church throughout its
              history, St. Olaf is a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
              in America. In 1900 the college department of the United Church
              Seminary was consolidated with St. Olaf, and in 1917 the college
              department of Red Wing Seminary was merged with St. Olaf. </p>
            <p class="body"> Many influences have combined to make St. Olaf what
              it is today. Dedicated faculty members have contributed to its
              academic reputation. Originating in the Norwegian immigrant desire
              for higher learning, the college has made a significant contribution
              to American liberal arts education while maintaining an academic
              center with a strong program for the study of Scandinavian culture.
              The rich St. Olaf tradition in music has gained worldwide renown
              for the college through its choirs and instrumental organizations.</p>
            <p class="body"> Since 1874 the college has had ten presidents: the
              Rev. Thorbjorn N. Mohn, who was first the principal of St. Olaf's
              School and then the president of St. Olaf College until 1899; John
              N. Kildahl, 1899-1914; Lauritz A. Vigness, 1914-1918; Lars W. Boe,
              1918-1942; Clemens M. Granskou, 1943-1963; Sidney A. Rand, 1963-1980;
              Harlan F. Foss, 1980-1985; Melvin D. George, 1985-1994; Mark U.
              Edwards, Jr., 1994 to 2000; Christopher M. Thomforde, 2001-2006; and David R. Anderson, 2006 &mdash; present. </p>
