                  (Romance Languages)</p>
                <p class="faculty"> <strong>Faculty, 2004-05:</strong> Wendy Allen (Romance Languages),
                  17th-century French literature, contemporary France, the Maghreb,
                  second language acquisition; Jolene Barjasteh (Romance Languages),

                <p class="programdescription">French holds
                    an important position among the world&rsquo;s
                  languages. More than 200 million people around the world &mdash; in
                  North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the
                  Middle East, the Pacific and Indian Oceans and Indochina &mdash; speak
                  French. French remains, with English, one of the two languages
                  into which all documents must be translated in the United Nations.
                  Thus, students considering careers in business, diplomacy,
                  the church or teaching wisely choose to complete a major in
                  French, sometimes along with another major. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Studying French and other Francophone cultures,
                  civilizations and literatures, students develop and enhance
                  oral and written language skills, analytical thinking and familiarity
                  with diverse philosophies and perspectives, all of which are
                  central to liberal arts education with a global perspective.</p>
                <p class="programdescription"> The French section of the Department of Romance
                  Languages offers a variety of courses, on campus and abroad,
                  in French language, Francophone cultures/civilizations and
                  literatures for beginning, intermediate and advanced students,
                  both majors and non-majors. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> To expand students&rsquo; exposure to French beyond the formal
                  classroom setting, the department promotes a French conversation
                  table and sponsors an honor house (Maison fran&ccedil;aise)
                  that serves as a focal point for Francophone cultural activities
                  (lectures, films, musical groups).</p>
                <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE FRENCH MAJOR </p>
                <p class="body"> In courses for the major, students gain understanding
                  of Francophone literatures, civilizations and contemporary
                  cultures as they develop analytical and communication skills
                in the language. </p>
                <p class="body"> 200-level courses are divided into two sequences.
                  In 250-level courses, students practice and refine their emerging
                  language skills through close textual analysis. In 270-level
                  courses, students explore the diverse cultures and literatures
                  of the Francophone world. </p>
                <p class="body"> 300-level courses build upon the interpretive
                  skills and knowledge of the Francophone world acquired by students
                  in 270-level courses. 300-level courses examine a particular
                  topic or genre as well as critical or theoretical issues associated
                  with it through the analysis of representative works. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </p>
                <p class="body"> All French majors are urged to study in France
                  or in another Francophone country. This is particularly important
                  to French teaching majors. </p>
                <p class="body"> Students who participate in an approved semester-long
                  St. Olaf study abroad program may count up to two courses in
                  French, plus one approved course in history, toward the major.
                  Students who participate in an approved year-long St. Olaf
                  study abroad program may count up to three courses in French,
            plus one approved course in history toward the major.</p>
                <p class="goldsubhead">                  Requirements for a Graduation Major: </p>
                <p class="body"> The graduation major consists of eight courses
                  in French above French 232 plus a co-curricular requirement
                  in history. Students must take: two 250-level courses; two
                  270-level courses, at least one of which must be taken on campus;
                  two 300-level courses taken on campus; two French courses of
                  the student&rsquo;s
                  choosing; and either History 226 or History 227 or an approved
                  history course taken abroad. Independent study or research
                  may not be counted in lieu of any of the courses referred to
                  above. </p>

                <p class="body"> Students must take: eight courses in French
                  above 232; one approved applied linguistics course (may be
                  taken abroad); History 226 or 227 or an approved history course
                  taken abroad; and Education 353 and all other requirements
                  of the K-12 teaching licensure program in French &mdash; see Department
                    of Education). The eight courses in French above 232 must
                    include one immersion course (French 233, 250, 275, or other
                    approved immersion course), two 250-level courses, two 270-level
                    courses, and two 300-level courses. Students not taking an
                    approved course in applied linguistics abroad must take English
                    274. Students who participate in an approved year-long St.
                    Olaf study abroad program may count three courses in French,
                    plus one approved course in applied linguistics, and one
                    in history toward the major. Independent study or research
                    may not be counted in lieu of any of the courses referred
                    to above. (Consult World Language Licensure Adviser.) </p>
