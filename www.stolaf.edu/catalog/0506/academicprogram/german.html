              <p class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2004-05:</strong> LaVern J. Rippley, German Romanticism
              and German Americana</p>
              <p class="faculty"> <strong>Faculty, 2004-05:</strong> Karen R. Achberger, 20th-century
                literature, Ingeborg Bachmann, Austrian literature; Monica Albrecht,

                of science; Joachim Liedtke, contemporary Germany and linguistics </p>
              <p class="programdescription">Studying the German language allows
                students to explore the interwoven cultural traditions of three
                countries located in the heart of Europe: Germany, a nation for
                just over a century but with origins that reach back to the Middle
                Ages, and the two smaller countries of Austria and Switzerland,
                each of which has played a significant role in the cultural and
                political development of Europe. At a time when Germany is playing
                an increasingly important political and economic role in the
                new Europe and the integration of East and West, the German language
                has been gaining pivotal significance as a medium of international
                negotiation. St. Olaf German graduates are proof that knowledge
                of German is a definite enhancement for any career.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In the cultural realm, Germany,
                Austria and Switzerland have produced some of Europe&rsquo;s greatest writers, natural and
                social scientists, artists, musicians, theologians and philosophers,
                many of whom are encountered in German course offerings. A major
                goal of the German Department is to provide courses and programs
                across disciplines and national boundaries.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>
              <p class="body"> Majoring in German allows students to deepen their
                understanding of German culture and to develop their communication
              skills in both the written and spoken language.</p>
              <p class="body"> Courses in the German major serve students who
                wish to pursue careers in business, education, the sciences or
                foreign service while also preparing them for a wide range of
                programs in German literature and culture studies. Each year,
                many German graduates continue their study at German universities
                with grants from the Fulbright Commission, the German Academic
                Exchange Service (DAAD) and others. German majors are strongly
                encouraged to participate in at least one of the study or internship
                opportunities in Germany (see below), during either an Interim,
              summer, semester or full-year program.</p>
              <p class="body"> In courses for the major, students gain an understanding
                of German literature, civilization and contemporary culture as
                they develop analytical and communication skills in the language.
              All courses for the German major are taught in German.</p>
              <p class="body"> Level II courses beyond the language requirement
                are divided into two sequences. At the 250-level, students develop
                their language skills while learning to do close textual analysis.
              At the 270-level, students explore the German-speaking world
              while continuing to refine their critical and language skills.</p>
              <p class="body"> Level III courses build upon students&rsquo; interpretive
                skills and their knowledge of the German-speaking world. Students
                examine in depth a particular genre or topic through the analysis
              and interpretation of representative works.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students need not be German majors to take Level
                II and III courses or to study abroad. Most begin their study
                of German in the 231-232 sequence. They complete this sequence
                and take at least one writing course on campus at the 250-level
                or above before spending a semester or a year studying in Germany.
                Courses taken in Germany may satisfy General Education requirements
                as well as requirements for the German major. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS/MINOR</p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> Graduation Major</p>
              <p class="body"> A student must take eight courses in German above
                232, including two 250-level courses, two 270-level courses (one
                of which must be taken on campus), two 370-level courses (one
                of which must be taken on campus) and two other courses of the
                student&rsquo;s
                choice. An internship taken abroad may count as one of the two
                courses a student may bring back from a semester&rsquo;s study
                in Germany or of the three courses a student may bring back from
                a year&rsquo;s study in Germany. Independent study or research
                may not be counted in lieu of any of the courses referred to
                above.</p>

                Students begin to learn German through listening, speaking,
                reading and writing about topics familiar to them (their personal
                biographies, family, daily life, interests). Regular language
                lab activities and the occasional singing of German songs aid
                in acquiring good pronunciation and listening skills. Offered
                Fall Semester.</p>
              <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="germ112"></a>112 Beginning German II</span><br>
              Students continue to develop oral language skills through in-class
                and language lab activities with both audio and video tapes.
                Regular written assignments aid in the expansion of vocabulary
                and in the practical application of grammatical concepts. Communicating
                in German about familiar personal topics, students acquire
                vocabulary about sports, food, holidays, school, the environment,
                life in German cities, Austrian and Swiss culture and German
                reunification. Prerequisite: German 111 or placement by test.</p>
              <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="germ231"></a>231 Intermediate German I</span><br>
              Students explore life in the German-speaking countries through
                reading and discussion of narrative texts. The course emphasizes
                vocabulary building, a thorough review of German grammar and
