              <span class="programdescription">St. Olaf College prepares teachers whose commitment to democratic
              ideals is manifested in their ability to address the needs of
              all students; their dedication to schools, communities, and society;
              and their commitment to the profession.</span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The Education
                  Department prepares highly qualified, reflective teachers who
                  integrate liberal arts, their subject major and professional
                  education. Reflective teacher candidates assess their options
                  and make sound professional decisions based on practical, pedagogical
                  and ethical criteria. Teacher candidates develop leadership
                  skills and contribute to the profession and to society. St.
                  Olaf's mission is to prepare its students to be &ldquo;seekers of truth, leading lives of unselfish service
                to others.&rdquo; The faculty members in the teacher education
                program share in this mission by preparing teachers who embrace
              this ideal. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Over 10 percent of St. Olaf graduates qualify
                for Minnesota teaching licenses each year. Most choose employment
                as educators in K-12 (kindergarten through grade 12) classrooms
                in the U.S. or abroad. Many also attend graduate school in special
                education, counseling or related human services fields.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF ST. OLAF&rsquo;S TEACHER EDUCATION
            PROGRAM</p>
              <p class="body"> St. Olaf is approved by the Minnesota Board of
                Teaching (BOT) to recommend its graduates for teaching licensure
                in Minnesota, and it is accredited by the National Council for
                Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). To be eligible for
                a teaching license through St. Olaf, students must meet the requirements
                  of their teaching &ldquo;content area&rdquo; (mathematics,
                  social studies, etc.), complete all B.A. or B.M. requirements
                  (which includes a graduation major) and complete all required
            education courses and experiences. (See requirements below.)</p>
              <p class="body"> The Higher Education Act, Title II, Section 207,
                requires all institutions that prepare teachers to report pass
                rates on state licensing tests. In Minnesota, teacher candidates
                were required to pass the Pre-Professional Skills tests in reading,
                writing and mathematics. One hundred (100) percent of the 49
                students who completed the St. Olaf Teacher Education Program
                in 2002-03 passed all PRAXIS I required by the state of Minnesota.
                [Beginning in 2001-02, Minnesota required additional tests in
                pedagogy and content area, PRAXIS II.] Students seeking licensure
                in other states should contact the teacher licensure agency in
            those states.</p>
              <p class="body"> Note: Because of periodic changes in licensure
                requirements, check with the Education Department regarding your
                program. </p>
