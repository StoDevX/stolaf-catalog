              <p class="programdescription">St. Olaf traditionally graduates more chemistry
                majors than any other four-year college in the United States.
                The college also ranks in the top five as a source of students
                who obtain the Ph.D. in chemistry and related fields. Chemistry
                faculty members have a fine record of achievement in teaching
                and research; several have won prestigious national awards. Students
                enjoy state-of-the-art instrumentation and computers in both
              laboratory and classroom.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The Chemistry Department offers an array of courses
                in the traditional areas of chemistry (organic, analytical, physical,
                inorganic). Courses in biochemistry, organometallic chemistry,
                environmental chemistry and other topics introduce students to
                interdisciplinary and bridging sciences that utilize a chemical
                perspective. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The department has an active summer research program,
                in which faculty and students work together to investigate problems
                of current interest. Students graduating with chemistry majors
                have had excellent success in gaining admission to graduate and
                professional schools and in obtaining employment opportunities.
                A major in chemistry may lead to employment in chemical research
                and in related areas such as medical applications of chemistry,
                environmental chemistry and materials science. A chemistry major
                also provides an excellent background for continued education
                in professional schools in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and
                related fields. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> Requirements for a Graduation Major </p>
              <p class="body"> Majors must complete Chemistry 125 (or 121 and
                123), 126, 247, 248, 255, 371, laboratory courses 253, 254, 256,
                357, and one additional course from 252, 372, 379, 380, 382,
                386, 388, or 391. In addition, students majoring in chemistry
                must take either Physics 124L and 125L (2.0 credits), or Physics
                126L, 127L, and 228/229L (3.25 credits); Mathematics through
                courses 126 or 128; and attendance during junior and senior years
                at 12 departmental seminars. Completion of at least one course
                credit in independent research (or having a summer research experience)
                is strongly recommended for students planning careers in chemistry.
                For more information, see www.stolaf.edu/depts/chemistry/major/index.html.</p>
              <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Physical Science Teacher Major
              (with a Chemistry Concentration) </p>
              <p class="body"> A chemistry major who wishes to teach chemistry
                in schools (5-12) must hold a valid Minnesota teaching license
                in physical science with a chemistry concentration. In addition
                to the chemistry major, additional science courses and the professional
                education sequence are required. Interested students should consult
                with a faculty advisor in the Education Department for details
                of requirements and available options. A physical science teaching
                minor is available.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY</p>
              <p class="body"> St. Olaf College is accredited by the American
                Chemical Society through its Committee on Professional Training.
                Prospective majors in chemistry who expect to comply with the
                minimum requirements of the committee will take the following
                courses: Chemistry 125 (or 121 and 123), 126, 247, 248, 253,
                254, 255, 256, 357, 371, 379, 380, 382, 378, 386 and one additional
                laboratory course selected from 373, 374, 375 or 376. Laboratory
                research experience may substitute for the additional laboratory
                course requirement with permission of the department chair. In
                addition, ACS-certified majors are required to take two mathematics
                courses beyond calculus II (Mathematics 126 or 128). This requirement
                is typically fulfilled by taking Mathematics 220 and one of Mathematics
                226 or 230.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students planning graduate work in chemistry should
                complete most of these courses, even if they do not fulfill all
                of the requirements for ACS certification. In particular, students
                  interested in graduate school should take Chemistry 386 by
                the end of the junior year so that they have taken the background
                  courses relevant to the Chemistry Graduate Record Examination
                  prior to fall of the senior year, when that examination is
                typically taken.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION </p>
              <p class="body"> The Chemistry Department seeks to encourage and
                recognize students who give evidence of creative and independent
                scholarship. A variety of opportunities are available for students
                to take a much greater responsibility for setting their goals
                and realizing the achievements of their education. Going beyond
                the regular course work, which introduces the theory and practice
                of chemistry, distinction challenges students to raise questions
                worthy of scientific investigation. Opportunities for distinction
                projects include, for example, summer research either on or off
                campus, Level II Independent Study (Chemistry 298), Level III
                Independent Research (Chemistry 398), Advanced Laboratory (Chemistry
                375), and faculty-approved literature research projects. All
                projects for distinction will be considered on a case-by-case
              basis.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students interested in distinction in chemistry
                should obtain details of the process from the Chemistry Department
                office. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </p>
              <p class="body"> St. Olaf chemistry majors have a number of options
                for special study, from the cooperative B.A.-B.S.E. Engineering
                Programs at Washington University in St. Louis and the University
                of Minnesota, where they may earn a degree in engineering, to
                  a concentration in molecular biology, to off-campus study in
                  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory program. Consult the Index
                  for information on each of these programs. The Chemistry Department
                  participates in the Foreign Language Across the Curriculum
                  (FLAC) Program, which offers students the opportunity to use
                  their foreign language skills in selected courses. (See the
                  listing under Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum.) </p>
