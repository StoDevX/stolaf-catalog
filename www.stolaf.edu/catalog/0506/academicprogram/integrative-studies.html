                <p class="programdescription">In the CIS, &ldquo;integrative studies&rdquo; refers to learning
                  that intentionally combines diverse methods, experiences, learning
                  styles, subject matters and on- or off-campus resources. The
                  college has a long-standing commitment to integrative studies,
                  evident in its many successful interdisciplinary majors and
                  concentrations, in the 30-year history of the St. Olaf Paracollege
                  and in the faculty&rsquo;s ability to combine diverse approaches
                  to course subjects. The CIS&rsquo;s principal activity is to
                  support students pursuing individual, integrative majors, but
                  it also offers a small curriculum of seminars and colloquia
                  exemplifying and encouraging integrative learning and helps
                  students to identify and exploit opportunities for integrative
                  learning on and off campus. In all these activities, the CIS's
                  goal is to enhance the coherence of students&rsquo; academic
                  careers by encouraging them to make meaningful connections
                  among the many parts of their educational experience and by
                  helping them build bridges between the college and other communities. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">The Individual Major </p>
                <p class="body"> The CIS certifies student-designed, integrative
                  majors. A student may propose any sequence of courses, seminars,
                  independent studies or experiential learning as the means of
                  pursuing an individual major. Among other things, the student&rsquo;s
                    proposal must include (1) a description of the proposed subject
                    matter; (2) a list of 10 or more proposed courses and other
                    learning experiences and an explanation of how each contributes
                    to the major; (3) an initial proposal for a two-semester
                    senior integrative project; and (4) a summary of the student's
                    preparation to carry out the proposed major. The proposal
                    must have the support of a faculty academic adviser. The
                    coherence, depth and feasibility of each proposal are evaluated
                    by a faculty review committee convened by the CIS. If the
                    proposal is approved, the student may pursue the individual
                    major with the support and encouragement of the CIS. When
                    the student&rsquo;s work is complete it is presented to a
                    faculty certification committee for review. Proposals for
                    individual majors may be submitted any time during the sophomore
                    year and at the beginning of the junior year. Illustrative
                    examples of recent approved individual majors include: Social
                    Policy; Health, Illness, and Medicine; Bilingualism; Conceptualizing
                    Cultural Difference; Religion and Society in the U.S.; Speech &amp; Language
                    (Science of Human Communication); Dynamics of Colonialism;
                    Peacemaking and the Arts; Environmental Discourse Analysis.</p>
                <p class="goldhead">The Web Portfolio</p>
                <p class="body"> To help students with individual majors to build
                  meaningful connections among the various parts of their undergraduate
                    careers and to demonstrate the coherence of their major work,
                    each maintains a web portfolio. A web portfolio presents
                    and preserves important formative experiences and academic
                    work. It is maintained in an electronic hyper medium (like
                    the World Wide Web) that allows students to make explicit
                    links among the parts of their work, to the work of other
                    students or to other sites of public discussion. The web
                    portfolio is presented to the faculty certification committee
                as part of the work of the major.</p>

significance of religion; and how people have conceptualized and acted upon places, events, and individuals

                  on selected topics, open to students in the sophomore year

                A conversation between methods and conclusions of Christian
                  theology and biology. Field and laboratory investigations,
                  along with accounts of scientific discoveries, introduce
                  the nature of scientific inquiry as a way of understanding
                  natural phenomena. Concurrently, we explore traditional Christian
                  understandings of how God is related to the natural world,
                  both normatively and historically. Offered Spring 2005. </p>

                This course explores the development of a uniquely American
                  theatrical form from the 1850's to the present. It cultivates
                  understanding of the form of musical theater, and uses musical
                  theater as a lens through which to view developments in American
                  culture. The course incorporates study of recordings, films,
                  and scores, as well as popular and scholarly research into
                  musical theater. Students will see and analyze performances,
                  but this is not a performance course. Offered Fall 2004. </p>
                <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="is212"></a>212 Sport and Religion: An Inquiry into American Cultural
                  Values</span><br>
                Sport and religion are two significant aspects of American
                culture. One could say sport has become a religion in our culture &mdash; with
                  saints, ruling patriarchs (coaches, managers, owners), &ldquo;gods&rdquo; (stars
                  and superstars), high councils, scribes (journalists), shrines
                  (halls of fame), houses of worship, symbols of faith (trophies,
                  game balls, clothing, shoes), and both true believers and converts.
                  Sport has been used to promote religion, and it has been used
                  as a means of enhancing faith. But is sport actually religious?
                  This course examines this question and others in an attempt
                  to come to a better understanding of the roles of sport and
                  religion in our culture. </p>

                  Each semester the CIS offers a thematic colloquium, open to
                juniors and seniors. Colloquia allow students to examine a
                broad, interdisciplinary topic or question using the tools
                and knowledge of their majors. Each new theme is connected
                to lectures, performances and other campus events, which provide
                starting points for discussion. Each semester&rsquo;s topic
                  is announced shortly before registration. Colloquium topics
                  have included &ldquo;Education and Social Responsibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;Expertise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Security,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pursuing
                  the New,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ways of Knowing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Authenticity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tradition.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="goldsubhead">INTEGRATIVE SENIOR PROJECT</p>
                <p class="body"> Students with individual majors register for
                  their senior integrative projects in each semester of the senior
                  year. The first semester, generally used for research and other
                  preparation in consultation with the student's adviser, receives
                  a P/N evaluation; the second semester, and final presentation
                  of the project to the faculty certification committee, receives
                  a grade. A brief description of the student's major and senior
                  project appear on the official transcript.</p>
