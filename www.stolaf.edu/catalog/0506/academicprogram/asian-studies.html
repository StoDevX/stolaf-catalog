              students with the opportunity to study East Asia, South Asia and 
              Southeast Asia. The department offers an Asian studies major and 
              concentrations in Asian studies, China studies and Japan studies. 
              A concentration in Asian studies &mdash; which presumes that a student 
              completes a major in another department &mdash; is ideal for students 
              with an interest in Asia who are majoring in economics, history, 
              religion, anthropology, art, political science or other areas. St. 
              Olaf offers many international programs in Asia. The concentrations 
              in China and Japan studies allow students to pursue advanced language 
              study with or without an Asian studies major. </p>

              of the many opportunities to study in Asia through St. Olaf programs

              of Asian Studies Department as fulfilling the appropriate course 
              requirements. Language study is offered through the Term in China 
              (Shanghai), ACM Japan Study (Tokyo), Ferris University (Yokohama), 
              Nagoya University (Nagoya), Nagasaki University of Foreign Studies 
              (Nagasaki) and Kansai Gaidai (Osaka, Japan). The ACM India Studies 
              program (Pune) offers area studies courses and intensive language 
              instruction without prerequisites. There are also programs in Asia 
              that do not require previous language study: Term in Asia, Global 
              Semester, Biology in South India, Interims and several study/service 
              opportunities. (See the Index under &ldquo;Off-campus Programs.&rdquo;)

            <p class="body"> Asian studies courses taken in St. Olaf off-campus

              Students who wish to count off-campus courses toward a major or 
              concentration should seek approval from the chair of the Asian Studies 
              Department before beginning their programs. Some restrictions apply.

              of the disciplines (such as history, literature, economics, anthropology, 
              religion, etc.) by taking additional courses that teach the methods

              This course prepares sophomores and juniors for upper level study

              methologies for individual research, including disciplinary and 
              interdisciplinary perspectives on select issues. Students use research tools systematically and compile annotated 
              bibliographies using bibliographic software. Prerequisites: Asian 
              Studies 121 or Asian Conversations sequence or permission of the instructor.</span></p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Asian Conversations Program</p>
            <p class="body"> The Asian Conversations program is an interdisciplinary 
              way to begin a liberal arts education. Whether you plan to major 
              in biology, economics, history, Asian studies or anything else, 
              the Asian Conversations program offers you an integrated, innovative 
              way to complete required study in foreign language and the liberal 
              arts. In the Asian Conversations program about twenty students will 
              study Chinese or Japanese language while they explore the cultures 
              of East Asia through the interdisciplinary courses listed below 
              (Asian Studies 111, 112, 211 and 212). </p>
            <p class="body"> During the January Interim of their second year, 
              students will have the option of traveling to China and Japan accompanied 
              by an Asian studies faculty member. A course focusing on the theme 
              &ldquo;National Identity in China and Japan&rdquo; will take students 
              to sites in Shanghai and Beijing in China and to Tokyo and Nagasaki 
              in Japan and allow them the chance to interact with peers in the 
              Asian language they have studied. Although this January study tour 
              is not required for Asian Conversations students, they will be given 
              priority in registering.</p>
            <p class="body"> <strong>Admittance to the Program:</strong> Registration 
              for Asian Conversations courses is limited to students admitted 
              into the program. Entering first-year students receive information 
              about the program soon after their admission to St. Olaf College.

              This seminar introduces students to East Asian cultures through 
              the familiar institution of family. In contemporary novels, autobiographies 
              and short stories, students read about the struggles between traditional 
              ideals and modern pressures as East Asians strive to define themselves

              This is a history seminar to help students understand the impact

              of sustained contact in the 16th century to the end of World War 
              II. Students read about and discuss the impact of Christian missionaries,

              Using rice (and agriculture more generally) as a means of access, 
              this course will introduce students to an examination of the societies, 
              politics and economies of East Asian countries. Drawing on social 
              science methods, it looks at traditional East Asian societies as 
              well as the drive for modernization and the consequences that modernization 
              has had on these societies. Prerequisite: Asian Studies 112 or permission

              This course studies eight to 10 Japanese films by well-known directors 
              such as Ozu, Kurosawa and Itami. Consideration is taken of the way

              This course looks at language as it creates and responds to its 
              cultural and social environments. Students compare and contrast 
              major aspects of language use in Japan and the United States. Students 
              explore the general underlying elements of talk (e.g., standard

              gendered speech patterns, communication styles) and learn to understand
