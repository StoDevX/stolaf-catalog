              <p class="programdescription">The Department of Art and Art History houses

                  expertise in the visual arts at St. Olaf. An outstanding, professionally

                  active faculty, an excellent art curriculum and a fine exhibition

                  program in Flaten Art Museum provide a wide range of offerings

                  in studio art, art history and art education.The mission of

                  the Department of Art and Art History at St. Olaf College is

                  to provide liberal arts students with opportunities to experience,

                  create, view and learn about visual images so they may better

                  understand themselves and the role of art-making in a global

                  society. The department&rsquo;s

                traditional commitment to art history, foundation design and

                technical expertise combines with the challenge of teaching critical

                thinking, creative innovation and exploring new ideas in visual

                media. An independent, national publication, Ruggs&rsquo; Guide

                to Undergraduate Education, recognizes the strength of the St.

                Olaf art program by naming it as one of the 30 most selective

                undergraduate art programs in the country. Art graduates have

                received national acclaim in many professional fields across

                the country &mdash; museum and gallery administration, advertising,

                architecture, computer graphics, graphic design, illustration,

                animation and film-making, studio art and teaching. </p>
