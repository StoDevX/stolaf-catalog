                <span class="programdescription">Inspired by the conviction that

                music is a divine gift, the St. Olaf College Music Department

                and academic breadth of the liberal arts in an environment of

                free, creative and critical inquiry. Through music we affirm

                the college&rsquo;s mission to foster

                the development of the whole person in mind, body and spirit.</span></p>

                instruction and a comprehensive undergraduate music curriculum.

                We honor St. Olaf&rsquo;s rich heritage spanning more than a

                century of international artistry and scholarship and will continue

                to cultivate a spirit of exploration and innovation, seeking

                OFFERED </p>

              <p class="body"> The Music Department offers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)

                and Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degrees, which are accredited by

                the National Association of Schools of Music: </p>

              <p class="goldsubhead">Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music</p>

              <p class="body"> This is a liberal arts degree, with approximately

                one-third of the course work in music. It is available in general

                music studies or with a teaching credential or with an emphasis

                in history-literature or theory-composition. The breadth of study

                  of a liberal arts degree offers students a wide range of career

                  options in music and related fields. Examples include performance,

                  broadcasting, multimedia, arts administration, advertising,

                  education, arts journalism, music librarianship or music therapy.

                  This degree also prepares students to pursue graduate study.

                  Students are admitted to the program by audition, either as

                  part of their application process or after beginning their

                  studies at St. Olaf.</p>

              <p class="goldsubhead">Bachelor of Music Degree</p>

              <p class="body"><strong>1. Bachelor of Music in Performance</strong></p>

                graduate work in preparation for careers in performance or private

                and college teaching. This degree is also a good base for an

                advanced degree in such fields as pedagogy and music therapy.

                Piano and organ performance majors may also pursue an emphasis

            in collaborative keyboard performance.</p>

              <p class="body"><strong> 2. Bachelor of Music in Church Music</strong></p>

              <p class="body"> Students in this program usually go on to graduate

                school or directly into parishes as church musicians. They may

                also pursue careers in conducting or college teaching or attend

            seminary to prepare for the ordained ministry. </p>

              <p class="body"><strong> 3. Bachelor of Music in Theory-Composition</strong></p>

                study is an option as well. </p>

              <p class="goldhead">Admission to the Music Major</p>

              <p class="body"> Students wishing to pursue a music major (either

                B.A. or B.M. degree) are required to audition on their principal

                instrument/voice, complete an examination covering basic music

                knowledge and have their keyboard skills assessed. Students may

                apply for entrance into the music major before enrolling at St.

                Olaf or after beginning their studies here. Credit for lessons

                taken before being accepted into the major may count toward the

                both B.A. and B.M., are processed in the second semester of the

                sophomore year. All prospective music education students are

                classified as B.A. music majors until that time. </p>

              <p class="body"> Before applying to the Teacher Education program,

                Training II), Music 114 (Theory II), and Music 251 (Conducting).

                The application procedure includes a performance in a recital

                and examinations in conducting (Music 251). </p>

              <p class="body"> Students are reviewed for continuance in the Teacher

                  proficiency and observations of teaching behavior, which are

                  assessed in Education 330 (Principles of Education). A student

                  not approved for continuance in the program is no longer in
