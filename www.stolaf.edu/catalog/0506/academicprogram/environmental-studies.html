              <p class="programdescription">Environmental studies combines the strengths of
                disciplinary work in the contributing departments together with
                interdisciplinary studies, giving both broad and focused perspectives
                on environmental problems and issues. The program offers a major
                in environmental studies with three tracks or options in which
                students may choose to focus their work: natural sciences, social
                sciences and arts and humanities. In many cases, work in these
                tracks overlaps with traditional departmental curricula, and
                students may choose to complete a second major there. Recognizing
                the global dimensions of many environmental problems and the
                need for learning outside of the classroom, the program provides
              a number of opportunities for studies abroad and in the field.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> All students majoring in environmental studies
                take four courses from a common set of core offerings which emphasize
                the interdisciplinary nature of environmental problems and issues.
                Students then choose one of the three tracks in which to focus
                their work. Courses required from two cognate groups outside
                of the selected track provide essential knowledge, methods and
                perspectives to complement the focus. All majors complete an
                experiential component during their studies and take a capstone
                course for a total of 12 required courses. Students wishing to
                count courses not specifically designated as satisfying requirements
                for the major may petition the Environmental Studies Advisory
                Board prior to enrollment. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The program also offers a concentration in environmental
                studies for students wishing to complement a disciplinary major
                with a smaller core of courses and electives focused on 
                the environment. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION </p>
              <p class="body"> Because of their interdisciplinary character,
                environmental studies courses are most appropriate for students
                seeking to fulfill general education requirements. The introductory
                seminar, Environmental Studies 137, serves many students in the
                NST (non-lab) area, and other environmental studies courses generally
              fulfill one or more of the general education requirements. </p>

              <p class="body">                The natural science track seeks to give students a broad exposure
              to the range of problems encountered by scientists working in

              providing a solid foundation for further study in one of the
              contributing disciplines. Students planning careers in environmental
              science are strongly urged to consider an additional major in
              biology or chemistry. Eight courses are required in addition

                This American environmental history explores the social construction
              of nature in the 20th century, looking at the roots (both natural
              and cultural) of contemporary environmental issues. To figure
              out what nature means to us now, we will study the history of
              stuff, the culture of grasslands and lawns, the changing character
              of the city and the country, the nature of the suburbs, the conservation
              and preservation movements, different energy ecologies, the nature
              of TV, the contemporary environmental movement and alternative
              ecological practices. We will also use the St. Olaf campus as
              a case study of 20th-century environmental design. </p>

              Conservation biology focuses on the study of biological diversity.
                We will examine why we should be concerned about the number
                and types of species on earth, what factors threaten the survival
                of species and how we can conserve them. Using principles of
                ecology and evolution, with input from other disciplines, students
                gain a better understanding of the impact of humans on biodiversity
                and the importance of responsible environmental decision-making.

              This interdisciplinary seminar uses basic concepts of environmental
                science to explore global environmental issues. Topics are
                drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and
                participants will recognize many of the seminar issues from
                coverage in the media. Because most environmental problems
                involve issues beyond the science, the seminar examines the
                economic, political and ethical dimensions of environmental
                questions and environmental decision-making. Offered every
                semester. </p>

              Population growth, industrialization and the consumption of fossil
                fuels have increased global environmental problems. The course
                examines the ways in which nation-states and/or international
                institutions have addressed these environmental concerns. Depending
                on the instructor, the focus of the course is either the environmental
                problems of a particular area (e.g., Latin America, Russia
                or Asia) or a broader global arena (e.g., international institutions
                and the environment). Counts toward major and concentration:

                  by humankind. It examines the climate system in the larger
                  framework of planetary evolution and explores evidence from
                  the geologic record for climates of the past. Using current
                  scientific literature, students investigate causes of climate
                  change and consider scenarios for future climate based on models
                  incorporating alternative global development strategies. Offered

                of other disciplines. We will survey available remote sensing
                image types and learn to process (ground-truthing, GPS, scanning,
                digitizing) and interpret remotely sensed images. We will also
                learn theory and practice of geographic information systems

              The discussion of wilderness today often focuses on non-human
                benefits, such as the protection of biodiversity or wildlife
                habitat. A significant tradition of American thought and literature
                also emphasizes the benefits of wilderness for human beings,
                including spirituality, freedom, morality, self-reliance and
                solitude. This seminar, offered annually, explores the importance

  Our planet Earth is a biosphere composed of many different habitats

                  near Tucson, Ariz., contains models of many of Earth&rsquo;s
                  biomes within an isolated structure. This offers a unique setting
                  to study community and ecosystem ecology, especially through
                  comparison with natural biomes present in the surrounding area.
                  Study at Biosphere 2 Center will be combined with a variety

                have worshipped and represented nature in paintings, photographs
                and advertisements. Students will learn to read landscapes, to
                discover how important artistically, religiously and ecologically
                the landscape tradition has been in the Unites States, and to
