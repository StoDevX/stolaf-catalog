                <p class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2004-05:</strong> Robert Jacobel, geophysics, ice
                and climate interactions</p>
                <p class="faculty"> <strong>Faculty, 2004-05:</strong> James Cederberg, atomic and
                  molecular physics; David Dahl, condensed-matter theory; Jason
                  Engbrecht, positron physics; Amy Kolan, mathematical physics,

                  Pettersson, glaciology, environmental studies; Brian Welch,
                  geophysics</p>
                <p class="programdescription">Physics is the study of how and why things
                    work &mdash; from
                  the minute world of the atomic nucleus to the universe itself &mdash; within
                  the context of a few fundamental laws. The goal of the physics
                  curriculum is to acquaint students with basic natural phenomena
                  and with the quantitative methods of experimentation and theoretical
                  analysis through which we come to understand them. It provides
                  an excellent preparation for students planning a technical
                  career in physics, engineering, astronomy or newly emerging
                  interdisciplinary programs (biophysics, geophysics, materials
                  science, chemical physics, etc.). In addition, physics supports
                  the background training of biologists, chemists and the concentrations
                  of environmental studies or computer science. Undertaking a
                  liberal arts physics program enables students to become technically
                  literate scientists who have a broad understanding of the world
                  and can communicate well. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION CREDIT </p>
                <p class="body"> Students planning to take a single physics course
                  should consider 112, 123, 124, 252 or 254. The two-semester
                  sequence, 124-125, makes some use of calculus and is appropriate
                  for students needing physics to support work in another major
                  (especially biology or chemistry).</p>
                <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>
                <p class="body"> Prospective physics majors should enroll in
                  126 and a calculus course in the Fall Semester of their first
                  year, although advanced placement may be given after consultation
                  with the department chair. Requirements for the physics major
                  include courses 126, 127, 228 and 229, 244 and 245, 374 and
                  384, 375 and 385, 376 and 386, and one physics elective numbered
                    above 120. (Note that the elective requirement is waived
                    for students obtaining teacher certification.) In some cases
                    it is possible to use the 124-125 sequence to transfer into
                    the major &mdash; see the chair. Calculus, linear algebra,
                    multivariable calculus and differential equations are prerequisites
              for some of the required courses. </p>
                <p class="body"> Students planning to apply for graduate study
                  in physics are advised to take Physics 379 and to consider
                  additional physics electives, complex analysis, abstract algebra,
                  probability, statistics, numerical analysis and real analysis.
                  A physics major is especially suited as preparation for graduate
                  study in electrical engineering with the inclusion of Physics
                  246 and independent study in electronics or computer interfacing. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION </p>
                <p class="body"> Students who demonstrate excellence in physics
                  coursework and who complete and report on an additional outside
                  project will be considered for distinction in physics. The
                  project may take the form of a public presentation on research
                  work or a topic of current interest in physics or written work
                    such as a published paper or a paper submitted for Physics
                    398 (Independent Research). Other activities may be eligible &mdash; check
                    with the department chair. In seeking to honor outstanding
                    coursework in the major, faculty members do not rely solely
                    on grades earned, but also consider factors such as improvement
                    and dedication. Faculty members nominate candidates who have
                    met the additional project criterion and a majority vote
                    is taken. Students who elect the S/U grading option for a
                    Level II or Level III physics course will not be eligible
                    for distinction in physics. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </p>
                <p class="body"> To obtain certification as a teacher of physical
                  science, a physics major must take the appropriate education
                  courses and some additional science courses. The Education
                  Department chair should be consulted for details of the available
                  options. The requirement for a physics elective is waived.                </p>
                <p class="body"> The computer science concentration (consult
                  Index) can be designed to emphasize computer hardware by inclusion
                  of Physics 246, computer interfacing (offered as an independent
                study) and independent study in electronics. </p>
                <p class="body"> Students interested in the engineering profession
                  may choose from two primary options. A cooperative five-year
                  program with either Washington University or the University
                  of Minnesota provides a B.A. degree from St. Olaf and a B.S.
                  in engineering from the university. Many students prefer instead
                  to complete a St. Olaf degree and then enter a master&rsquo;s
                  degree program at an engineering school of their choice. Such
                  a route typically takes 1.5-2 years beyond the B.A. Students
                  contemplating either of these options should consider taking
                  the intensive Interim course in engineering offered at Washington
                University.</p>
                <p class="body"> In recent summers, approximately 10 research
                  positions have been available on campus for students interested
                  in working with faculty on current research projects. These
                  projects are supported by outside funding agencies and provide
                  a stipend for student participants. Areas of faculty interest
                  include: atomic force microscopy (Dahl), atomic spectroscopy
                  (Nitz), geophysics, ice and climate interactions (Jacobel),
                  mathematical physics (Kolan), molecular beam spectroscopy (Cederberg)
                  and positron physics (Engbrecht). <br>
                  Students also may register during the year for 398 (Independent
                  Research) or apply to the Oak Ridge Science Semester Program
                  (see Index). International programs which can include course
                  work in physics are the British University programs at Lancaster
                  and the University of East Anglia.</p>

                  A basic introduction to astronomy, this course concentrates
                on &ldquo;How do we know what we know?&rdquo; Students explore
                  questions such as &ldquo;How do we measure the distance to
                  a star?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do we know the universe is expanding?&rdquo; In
                  addition to studying the solar system, stars, black holes,
                  galaxies and the history of the universe, students engage in
                  rooftop viewing using the department&rsquo;s telescopes. Prerequisite:

                <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="phys123"></a>123 Geophysics: Perspectives on the Dynamic Earth</span><br>
  This course considers a variety of topics in earth and environmental
                    science. Beginning with the origin of the earth and planetary
                    systems, the course examines crustal evolution and plate
                    tectonics, geologic resources and hazards and the relationship
                    of these surface phenomena to processes occurring in the
                    earth&rsquo;s interior. It concludes with a study of the
                    oceans, the atmosphere, the earth&rsquo;s climate system
                    and environmental change. Prerequisite: proficiency in algebra
                    and geometry. Offered Fall Semester.</p>
