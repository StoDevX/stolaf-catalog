              <p class="programdescription">The aim of the Philosophy Department is to engage
                students in disciplined and imaginative thinking about philosophical
                issues. Philosophical questions fall primarily into four groups:
                questions about the nature of reality (metaphysics), about reasoning
                and inference (logic), about knowledge (epistemology) and about
                values and society, including moral values (ethics) and aesthetic
                values. These questions arise naturally in the course of a liberal
                education; they are not only fascinating in their own right,
                they also touch on issues central to understanding and improving
                human life in society and the world. These are complex and controversial
                issues, and there are no easy answers. Yet it matters greatly
                which answers are accepted, and it is therefore important to
                engage in discussion with others who face these questions and
                to seek to learn from the philosophers of the past and present.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Engaging in philosophy
                  develops skills in careful and fair-minded interpretation,
                  creative but rigorous argumentation, and reflective and wise
                  evaluation of complex issues. These abilities are extremely
                  valuable for life as a whole and are applicable to any subject
                  matter and in any human context. Most of our students discover
                  that these skills make philosophy very useful for continuing
              their education not only in philosophy but in other fields as
              well and for negotiating the ambiguities of today&rsquo;s career
                paths. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </p>
              <p class="body"> A major in philosophy is highly recommended not
                only for those who wish to pursue graduate study in philosophy
                but also as preparation for law, theology, business, management,
                medicine, journalism, politics, education and other careers that
                require the ability to think in a creative and disciplined manner
                about questions which are new or whose method of solution is
              debated. </p>
              <p class="body"> Students can find a Philosophy Department course
                that satisfies one of all six categories of core General Education
                requirements. Also, a significant number of the courses that
                satisfy the WRI and EIN requirements are taught by philosophers.
                In the philosophy commons room, the department provides for each
                term a prospectus that describes the special focus and the expected
                reading and writing for each course and section. Great Conversation
                students receive credit for one philosophy course toward the
                major. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
              <p class="body"> A major in philosophy may be attained by completing
                the requirements for either a regular major or a contract major.
                Most philosophy courses simultaneously count toward the major
                and toward one or more General Education requirements. </p>
              <p class="body"> A regular major requires at least nine courses
                in philosophy, including Philosophy 235 (Ancient and Medieval
                Philosophy), Philosophy 236 (History of Modern Philosophy), Philosophy
                240 (Formal Logic and Philosophy) and three Level III seminar
                courses. These specifications seek to assure a major&rsquo;s grasp of the history and methods
                  of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical
                inquiry. </p>
              <p class="body"> A contract major involves a contract drawn up
                between the student and the Department of Philosophy. The contract
                combines seven courses in philosophy &mdash; including Philosophy 235 and 236,
                two Level III seminar courses, and either a logic project or
                Philosophy 240 &mdash; with three Level II or III courses in
              another department chosen to complement the work in philosophy.</p>
              <p class="body"> These requirements give students a great deal
                of leeway to pursue their own interests. Those who wish to develop
                a balanced understanding of philosophy should take a number of
                courses in each of the following categories: I. history of philosophy
                (118-intensive, 233, 235, 236, 251, 374); II. metaphysics and
                epistemology (231, 240, 241, 244, 371, 372); and III. ethics
                and value theory (119, 120, 147, 153, 243, 245, 250, 252, 254,
                256, 257, 261, 373). Categories for 375 and 399 vary year by
                year. It is also possible to specialize in one of these areas,
                but students are strongly encouraged to take at least one, and
                preferably two, courses in each of the areas outside their specialization. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION</p>
              <p class="body"> Departmental distinction in philosophy is awarded
                by a vote of the department to those graduating students whose
                discourse, both oral and written, shows excellence in such philosophical
                  virtues as clarity, coherence, cogency, sensitivity to the
                  full range of relevant considerations, fair-mindedness, rigor,
                  creativity and imagination. Candidates submit a portfolio of
                  papers by April 15 to the department chair. A sheet describing
                  the details of applying for distinction is available in the
                  philosophy commons room.</p>

              An examination of the development of historically significant
                conceptions of reality and knowledge. In order to see the historical
                contribution of philosophy to the self-understanding of Western
                culture, students study major philosophers from ancient, medieval,
                and modern Western philosophy, focusing on the ways they have
                related their explanations of the universe to their conceptions
                of meaningful human life. Some sections offer a survey of Western
                philosophy while others stress intensive study of central figures
                and works. Consult departmental prospectus for details. Open
                to first-year students and sophomores only. Offered both semesters. </p>
              <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="philo119"></a>119 Moral Psychology</span> <br>
              This seminar introduces students to the discipline of philosophy
                by focusing on psychological issues related to moral behavior.
                Students study those states of mind and character that are
                thought to constitute moral (or evil) character and produce
                moral (or evil) actions, relationships and societies. Guilt,
                shame, humility, self-respect; sympathy, compassion, caring,
                anger; truthfulness, courage, self-knowledge: what are these
                states? And what influence does their presence or absence have
                on human relationships and society? Open to first-year students

              <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="philo120"></a>120 Philosophy in Literature</span><br>
              Students analyze literary works of different genres as aesthetic
                treatments of philosophical themes. Poetry, prose and drama
                explore themes such as the metaphysics and ethics of freedom,
                the problem of evil and the role of character in choice and
                action. For example, with Camus students explore such ideas
                as absurdity, lucidity, rebellion and human solidarity by studying
                plot, character, point of view, imagery and symbolism. Offered
                only in Interim.</p>
              <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="philo147"></a>147 Death and the Meaning of Life</span><br>
  This course introduces philosophical ideas and methods through
                  reading, discussing and writing about basic questions that
                  arise when we reflect on the human condition. What is meant
                  by &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; when one asks whether (a person&rsquo;s)
                  life has meaning? How do our beliefs about human nature, religion
                  and morality affect how we ask or answer the question? How
                  does our mortality affect our living? Classical and contemporary
                  writings &mdash; philosophical and autobiographical &mdash; will
                  be used. Offered only in Interim. </p>

              Is there anything about the human mind that cannot be understood
                scientifically? Are we simply complex physical machines? Students
                examine the recent history of attempts to establish a science
                of psychology as well as current psychological theories and
                their conceptual foundations. The philosophical implications
                of these theories for our understanding of such things as the
                relation between minds and brains, freedom and determinism,
                reason and emotion and the nature of the self are also explored.
                Offered every year. </p>

  An introduction to Kierkegaard&rsquo;s work and existentialism,
                this course emphasizes the aesthetic, ethical and religious &ldquo;stages
                on life&rsquo;s way&rdquo; in becoming a self. Students examine
                how existential philosophers and authors have portrayed the meaning
                of human existence, passion and faith, despair, the absurd, freedom
                and choice. Offered every year. </p>

              Contemplating art in relation to aesthetic as well as religious
                and moral values, students address such issues as the nature
                of creation and creativity, the character of visual metaphor
                and the meaning of selected historical and contemporary works
                of art. While developing a more informed appreciation of aesthetic
                properties of art, students analyze major texts in philosophy
                of art and art criticism. Offered every year. </p>

                science such as scientific method, theory, objectivity, observation,
                confirmation and explanation. Students engage political or
                civic controversies that turn on the scientific status of particular
                practices in order to articulate an understanding of scientific
                practice necessary for the informed citizen. Such controversies
                include creationism, global warming and repressed memory syndrome.

                  or contemporary philosophical views that underlie as well as
                  those that challenge these institutions, including views of
                  human nature, gender, rationality, knowledge, morality, justice

  This course considers the relationships between moral principles,
                  law and the practice of governments. Should governments act

              Moral issues concerning friendship and love are analyzed from
                the perspective of various theories of value. Issues may include
                friendship and the moral life, exploitative versus fulfilling
                relationships, the conflict between altruism and self-love,
                forgiveness, reconciliation and civic friendship. Since loving
                is itself a form of valuing, value theory is approached by
                investigating philosophical and theological works concerning
                the basic types of love: philia, eros and agape. Students are
                introduced to normative ethical theories. Offered most years.</p>

                the use of economic categories to assess wilderness areas and
                endangered species, the conflict between eco-holism and individualism
                and the philosophy of wilderness management. Offered every

  This is a course in thinking morally, both about the vices and
                  virtues and other normative moral perspectives (e.g., Kantian,
                  Humean, utilitarian) and about oneself. In what ways are the
                  virtues a foundation for thinking and living in daily life?
                  What are alternative proposals for &rsquo;the good life&rsquo; and &rsquo;right&rsquo; by
                  which we conceive human behavior normally? In what ways does
                  a Christian perspective modify our understanding of ourselves
                  and the virtues? Offered only during Interim.</p>

  Students examine Freud&rsquo;s thesis that our thoughts and actions
                spring from the darkness of our unconscious. Because Freud based
                his theory on a small sample of case studies, the class scrutinizes
                this qualitative data and discusses the role of case studies
                in the study of human behavior. Students evaluate the criteria
                for a scientific theory of human behavior and consider whether
                Freud&rsquo;s theory meets them. Offered only during Interim. </p>
