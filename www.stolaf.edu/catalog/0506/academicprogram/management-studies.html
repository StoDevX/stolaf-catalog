            <p class="programdescription">Management studies is a multidisciplinary program
              offering contract concentrations in management and financial management
              that can be earned in conjunction with any B.A. academic major.
              Individual contracting encourages students to consider personal
              goals as they design a program of courses in management studies,
              economics and other disciplines. The Management Studies Program
              also supports the management and finance areas of emphasis within
              the economics major (see Department of Economics).</p>
            <p class="programdescription"> To meet the challenges of an ever-changing world,
              graduates must be ready to take advantage of opportunities and
              create their own success. A St. Olaf liberal arts education encourages
              students to view the world from multiple perspectives, build fundamental
                communication and problem-solving skills, wrestle with questions
                of ethics and develop a global perspective. The management studies
                concentration connects theory and practice and helps students
              make the transition from college to career. </p>
            <p class="programdescription"> The management studies concentration prepares students
              for careers in domestic and international business, not-for-profit
              and governmental organizations and entrepreneurial ventures. Students
              direct their efforts by choosing elective courses and experiences
              that focus on a special area of interest. For example: a student
              who hopes to start a business can elect to take Management Studies
              256 (Entrepreneurship), participate in the special Estenson Internship
                Program which provides a paid summer internship in an entrepreneurial
                firm and apply for a Finstad Office grant to pursue a business
                idea. (See information about the Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial
                Studies below.)</p>
            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR A MANAGEMENT 
              STUDIES CONCENTRATION </p>
            <p class="body"> The management studies concentration is arranged
              by individual contract. The concentration includes (1) a five-course
              program of study, (2) an Experiential Component; and (3) an Electronic
                Integrative Folder.</p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Course Requirements: </p>
            <p class="body"> Students meet with a member of the management studies
              faculty to develop a five-course program of study which includes
              three core and two elective courses. Core courses for the management
                  studies concentration include Economics 121 or 122, Management
                  Studies 225 and 251. Electives include an additional management
                  studies course and an approved course from another department
                  on campus or a study abroad program. Students must earn a grade
                  of C or better in the five courses. </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Experiential Learning: </p>
            <p class="body"> This component is met by completing two approved 
              experiences in which the student applies management or financial 
              principles to real world problems. One of the activities must be 
              <span class="change-strikethrough">an</span> <span class="change-red">a 
              full credit </span>Academic <span class="change-strikethrough">or Recognition</span> Internship or an approved 
              work experience. The other activity can be a volunteer, leadership, 
              entrepreneurial or related work experience. The Internship Office, 
              Career Connections Center, Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial Studies 
              and other organizations help students complete this requirement. 
            </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">The Electronic Integrative Folder: </p>
            <p class="body"> The Electronic Integrative Folder introduces students
              to an important career planning process, helping them to identify
              career options and access opportunities. The folder includes the
              results of self-assessment and career exploration activities, a
              description of future goals and an academic and experiential action
              plan, as well as projects, papers and other work that demonstrate
                  specific skill development. The Integrative Folder is presented
                  on a CD. By interconnecting important pieces in a digital folder,
                  students can demonstrate the interrelatedness of their varied
                  learning experiences.</p>

            <p class="body"> The Paul and Anne Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial
              Studies promotes growth and dissemination of information about
