              <p class="programdescription">Political science
                  is the systematic study of government, politics, and public
                  policies in the United States and around the world. Students
                  in political science courses learn to frame thoughtful questions,
                  consider diverse perspectives, marshal convincing evidence
                  and communicate with clarity and conviction about the major
                  issues of public life. Many political science courses satisfy
                  General Education requirements (see below). The Political Science
                  Department shares faculty and courses with American studies,
                  Asian studies, environmental studies, Hispanic studies, Russian
                  studies, and women&rsquo;s
                  studies. It also cooperates with the Education Department in
                its social studies education major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The study of
                  political science is often combined with majors in English,
                  economics, history, philosophy, foreign language or any of
                  a number of interdisciplinary majors and concentrations. Many
                  political science students go on to complete graduate and professional
                  degrees, not only in political science but also in law, education,
                  public policy, international affairs, management and administration
                  or communications. Our graduates become policy analysts, teachers,
                  legislators, advocates, attorneys, business owners, consultants,
                  public relations managers, ambassadors, administrators, researchers,
                  and journalists. The study of political science enriches students&rsquo; experience
                  of the liberal arts and prepares them to engage in public life
                as responsible citizens and reflective leaders. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>
              <p class="body"> The political science major provides broad exposure
                to the discipline and develops skills in critical thinking, systematic
                inquiry, and effective writing and speaking. Students majoring
                in political science complete courses in four areas: American
                politics and public policy; comparative politics; international
                relations; and political theory. Political science majors also
                encounter and apply a variety of approaches to studying political
                behavior and public policy, with particular emphasis on social
                scientific inquiry. Advanced seminars and independent study courses
                provide opportunities for specialized study and advanced research.
                  Off-campus courses, internships and other experiential learning
                  experiences engage students with the realities of public life.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
              <p class="body"> Students majoring in political science must complete
                a minimum of nine courses in the discipline, including no more
                than three Level I courses, one course introducing research methods
                (Political Science 220, Analyzing Politics and Policy), and no
                fewer than two Level III courses. </p>
              <p class="body"> Majors must include at least one course from each
                of the four subfields: American politics and public policy (111,
                114, 115, 215, 235, 246, 255, 272, 276, 311, 373); comparative
                politics (112, 117, 251, 252, 256, 264, 282, 367, 386); international
                relations (121, 257, 258, 281, 285, 321) and political theory
                (113, 222, 232, 249, 259, 260, 270, 384). The subfield designation
                of Political Science Topics (199, 299), Independent Study (298),
                Independent Research (398), Seminar (399), Interim courses or
                other courses not listed above depends on the content of the
                course in a given semester; students should consult with their
                advisers and with the department academic administrative assistant
                to determine the appropriate subfield for one of these courses.
                All Level III courses are offered as seminars with two prerequisites:
                PS 220 and one other course in the relevant subfield.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students may designate a selected Statistics course
                (110, 212, 262, 266 or 312) OR one additional semester of language
                beyond the level of proficiency required for General Education
                (French, German or Spanish numbered above 232 or Chinese, Greek,
                Latin, Japanese, Norwegian or Russian numbered above 231) as
                one of their nine courses in the political science major. Additional
                    study in statistics and/or foreign language is especially
                recommended for students considering graduate study.</p>
              <p class="body"> Political science majors are also encouraged to
                seek out opportunities for experiential or applied study through
                internships, off-campus study, on-campus courses with an experiential
                  component, or independent projects under faculty supervision.
                  Up to two off-campus courses instructed by non-St. Olaf faculty
                  may be included in the major. An internship for academic
                  credit may also count toward the major, although internships
                  cannot be used to satisfy subfield requirements. Additional
                  suggestions and guidelines for including off-campus work
                  and experiential study in the political science major are
                  available in the department; students are encouraged to consult
                  with their advisers in making their plans.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">General Education</p>
              <p class="body"> The Political Science Department offers courses
                that satisfy General Education requirements in Human Behavior
                and Society (HBS), Historical Studies in Western Culture (HWC),
                Multicultural Studies (MCS) and Ethical Issues and Normative
                Perspectives (EIN). In addition, all Level III courses are designated
                Courses with Writing (WRI).</p>
              <p class="goldhead">Distinction</p>
              <p class="body"> Distinction in political science is awarded to
                graduating students whose work reflects the qualities of exemplary
                scholarship in the discipline: theoretical competence, skillful
                research, analytic ability, original thinking, clear and compelling
                discourse and significance for public life. In addition to meeting
                minimum grade point average requirements (3.4 overall, 3.7 within
                the major), senior candidates for distinction submit for departmental
                  review a major research paper demonstrating these qualities.
                  Candidates must notify the department chair of their intention
                  to seek distinction in the first week of the spring semester
                  and must submit their distinction papers no later than April
                  15. Further information on distinction in political science
                  is available in the department or on the department&rsquo;s
                  website.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>
              <p class="body"> Political science students may choose from a rich
                assortment of domestic and international off-campus study opportunities,
                  some during Interim and others lasting a semester or more (see
                  Index). They can also arrange for credited internships in a
                  wide variety of settings, from law offices and campaign organizations
                  to the national or state legislature. Further information on
                  internships, Interim off-campus course offerings and other
                  special programs such as the Washington Semester and international
                  programs with political science credit, is available in the
                  department or from the Office of International and Off-Campus
                  Studies.</p>

                The promise of American politics is the equal freedom of all.
              How does practice match principles? What roles do class and race
              play? Do interest groups and political parties foster democracy?
              This course is designed not only to help students understand

  American politics is about ideas. The rule of the people is superior
                  to the rule of the few. Free speech is good. Political power
                  should be distributed, checked and balanced, and federalized.
                  This course traces the origins of these and other important

                to economic support simply because we are members of society,
                or should we accept impoverishment as the just consequence
                of failure in the market? Students examine Christian and non-Christian
                ethical traditions from Europe and America which are devoted

                Students will examine the political history, political culture,
                institutions and structures in this region and analyze the
                manner in which they have contributed to political phenomena
