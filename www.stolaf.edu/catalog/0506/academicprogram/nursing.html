		<p class="programdescription"><span class="change-red">Nursing, the largest of the health professions, is founded on a commitment of service to
others and focuses on the health and well being of society. Nursing practice involves four
areas: promoting health and wellness, preventing illness, restoring health and care of the
dying.</span> </p>
              <p class="programdescription">The Minnesota Intercollegiate Nursing Consortium
                (MINC), the nursing program at St. Olaf working in cooperation
                with that of Gustavus Adolphus College, offers students the opportunity
                to enjoy a St. Olaf education, earn a bachelor of arts degree
                with a major in nursing, enroll in nursing courses with students <span class="change-red">outside the major and </span>
                from another college, enjoy courses taught by professors from
                two colleges and have clinical learning experiences in a wide
                variety of local and Twin Cities medical and health care centers,
                long-term care facilities, community agencies, home health and
                other facilities. By combining the values of the individual and
                a liberal arts background with the acquisition of professional
                knowledge and nursing skills, the program integrates development
                of the whole person, a commitment to lifelong learning and service
                to others with a holistic approach to the practice of professional
              nursing. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The program, which is accredited by the National
                League for Nursing and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education
                and has been approved by the Minnesota Board of Nursing, spans
                four academic years. <br>
              Upon graduation, students are eligible to apply for initial licensure
              by examination for registered nurses offered by the National
              Council of State Boards of Nursing and, upon licensure, can apply
              for certification as a public health nurse in Minnesota. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </p>
              <p class="body"> The program<span class="change-red">, through an innovative design that integrates theory with practice and partners educators
with professionals in practice,</span> prepares graduates to provide and
                coordinate nursing care for individuals, families and communities
                within standards of professional practice utilizing the Neuman
                Systems Model. Students learn to think critically, communicate
                effectively and implement therapeutic nursing interventions within
                the sociocultural, spiritual and developmental context of <span class="change-red">patient </span><span class="change-strikethrough">client</span>
                situations. </p>
              <p class="body"> Graduates are qualified to work in hospitals,
                public health agencies and clinics, to give high quality nursing
                care to patients and families and to direct the nursing care
                given by others. They have the background for graduate study
                in nursing programs which can prepare them for advanced nursing
                practice, teaching, administration and research. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL</p>
              <p class="body"> Information regarding the national accreditation
                status of the program can be obtained from the National League
                for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC), 61 Broadway &mdash; 33rd floor,
                  New York, NY 10006, (212) 363-5555, and from the Commission
                  on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), One Dupont Circle NW,
                  Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036-1120, (202) 887-6791. Information
                  regarding state approval of the program is available from the
                  Minnesota Board of Nursing, 2829 University Ave., Suite 500,
                  Minneapolis, MN 55414, (612) 617-2270. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS OF THE MAJOR </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> Admission and Progression </p>
              <p class="body"> Students are encouraged to express an interest
                in the nursing major upon application for admission to <br>
                St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the program is limited and admission
                  is competitive; therefore, early consultation with the department
                  chair is recommended. Interested students are assigned nursing
                  faculty as academic advisers. Recognizing the cooperative relationship
                  that exists between Gustavus Adolphus College and St. Olaf
                College as participants in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Nursing
                Consortium (MINC), no college in MINC will accept, as transfers
                in nursing, students who have taken the pre-nursing or nursing
                curriculum from the other institution in the consortium. In exceptional
                  circumstances (e.g. withdrawal from college for a period of
                one year), a student may petition to the MINC director for an
                exception to this policy.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students must apply for admission to the nursing
                major during the fall of the sophomore year. Application information
                is available from the department chair. Admission criteria include
                  cumulative grade point average, grades in prerequisite courses,
                  essay, interview and student status. Students will be notified
                  of their conditional acceptance into the major by a letter
                  from the department chair before the Spring Semester of the
                  sophomore year. Nursing courses begin in the fall of junior
                year.</p>
              <p class="body"> Conditional acceptance into the nursing major
                will become final if students meet the following criteria at
                the end of the sophomore year: a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.70
                and successful completion of all nursing prerequisite courses.
                Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade. Only one prerequisite
                course may be below C-, and this course (or an alternate course
                approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once.
                A minimum grade of C must be achieved in the repeated or substituted
                  course. If a grade of C is not achieved in the repeated or
                  substituted course, the student may not continue in the major.
                  If two or more prerequisite courses are below C- the student
                may not continue in the major.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students not accepted may choose to be placed
                on a waiting list and will be notified of their rank on that
                list. If openings occur, admission will be offered to waiting
                list students by rank, highest rank first. Students on the waiting
                list may also reapply for admission to the nursing program the
                following year. They will be considered in the next pool of applicants
                  but will not be guaranteed admission because they apply a second
                time.</p>
              <p class="body"> In addition to the college health requirements,
                nursing students must also provide documentation of: immunization
                to Hepatitis B, measles, mumps, varicella and rubella, and negative
                Mantoux or Tine (TB) test or negative chest x-ray after June
                1 of both the junior and senior years in the major.</p>
              <p class="body"> Continuous certification in CPR (Basic Life Support
                for health providers) must be maintained throughout the major
                according to American Heart Association guidelines. Students
                should complete a CPR course prior to beginning nursing courses
                that meets these guidelines and provides certification for the
                two-year period they are enrolled in the major.</p>
              <p class="body"> In order to be qualified to provide direct patient
                services, students must undergo an annual criminal background
                study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Human Services
                (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by the MDHS, he or she will
                be unable to provide direct patient care. Direct patient care
                is a requirement of the nursing major. If a student is disqualified
                and cannot provide direct patient care, he or she will be dismissed
                from the nursing program.</p>
              <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for Graduation</p>
              <p class="body"> Students must meet all college requirements for
                graduation, as well as complete eight prerequisite courses, one
                supporting course and <span class="change-strikethrough">10</span> <span class="change-red">11</span> upper division nursing courses. <span class="change-red">The required courses are Nursing 302,
