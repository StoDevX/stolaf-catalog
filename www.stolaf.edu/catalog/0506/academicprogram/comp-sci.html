                <p class="programdescription">Computer science
                    (CS) is the academic discipline that focuses on concepts
                    of computing and develops valuable analytical skills in theory,
                    abstraction and design. St. Olaf&rsquo;s CS program
                  employs &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; experience to build up valuable
                  technical skills while reinforcing abstract concepts in a liberal
                  arts context. The program&rsquo;s primary objective is to offer
                  an authentic and satisfying education in the concepts and practices
                  of computer science; the courses below represent national expectations
                  for an undergraduate computer science curriculum. The program
                  also incorporates a distinct liberal arts perspective, including
                  emphasis on teamwork and communication skills, examination
                  of ethical and social issues in computing and collaboration
                in upper-level interdisciplinary projects.</p>
                <p class="body"><span class="programdescription"> Although CS differs from other computing areas,
                  such as programming, information technology (IT) and information
                  systems (IS), the study of computer science serves as excellent
                  preparation for careers in such fields, because the concepts
                  of computer science provide insights into all forms of computing.
                  While specific computing systems come and go, the principles
                  of CS endure for the long term, and persons with awareness
                  of those principles perceive them in all forms of computing.
                  The program's emphases on development of analytical thinking
                  abilities, interpersonal skills and ethical analysis and awareness
                  enhance any career, whether one becomes an occasional user
            or a computing professional.</span></p>
                <p class="subhead">              General Education</p>
                <p class="body"> Courses in computer science satisfy the following
                  General Education requirements: MAR, WRI, ORC and EIN. See

                <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>
                <p class="body"> A student arranges for a computer science major
                  by individual contract with the computer science faculty. This
                  provides some latitude for choice according to personal preference
                    and allows the computer science faculty to update the curriculum
                    easily as the field of computer science evolves, without
                    affecting students who have already declared majors. Most
                    contracts adhere to the guidelines below, which derive from
                    prominent national recommendations for undergraduate computer
                    science majors.</p>
                <p class="body"><strong>Foundation courses:</strong> Either Computer Science 121,
                  251 and 252, or Computer Science 125; Computer Science 231;
                Computer Science 241.</p>
                <p class="body"> <strong>Core courses:</strong> Computer Science 253; Computer
                  Science 263; either Computer Science 233 or 276; and either
                Computer Science 273 or 284.</p>
                <p class="body"> <strong>Electives and capstone:</strong> Computer Science 390
                and two approved electives.</p>
                <p class="body"> These guidelines represent four levels:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="body"> a breadth-first introduction to the
                      discipline, through a hands-on survey of concepts (Computer
                      Science 121 or 125) and three &ldquo;second courses&rdquo; (Computer
                      Science 231, 241, 251) that may be taken in any order (note
                      that the foundation courses offer non-majors a variety
                    of one- to four-course samples of computer science);</li>

                  <li class="body"> a deeper exposure to selected aspects of the discipline
                    of computer science through electives; and</li>

                <p class="body"> The computer science concentration has been
                  replaced by the major, but remains available to students who
                  entered St. Olaf during academic year 2002-03 or earlier. A
                  contract for a computer science concentration typically includes
                  Computer Science 121, 241, 251, 252, 253, 276 and one elective
