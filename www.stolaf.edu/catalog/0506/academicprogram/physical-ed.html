              <p class="programdescription">Physical education is the study of human movement, from its
                analysis to application in educational and sport settings. Its
                aim is the improvement of human performance and the enhancement
                of human development through the medium of physical activity
                throughout the lifespan. St. Olaf offers an exercise science
                major, a variety of activity courses to meet the core curriculum
                requirements for graduation, intramural and club sports and 27
                varsity sports. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION </p>
              <p class="body"> Two different one-quarter (0.25) activity courses
                from the Departments of Physical Education and/or Dance, or one
                one-half (.50) course from the Department of Physical Education
                fulfill the physical activity requirement in the General Education
                curriculum. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
              <p class="body"> The exercise science major is an in-depth, multidisciplinary
                  study of human movement and performance in sport-related fields
                  (10.0 courses, 10 titles). The major supports academic linkages
                  across disciplines and provides excellent preparation in a
                  wide variety of fields. It is recommended that this major be
                  complemented by other majors or concentrations of interest
                  to the student (such as psychology, management studies, history,
                  women&rsquo;s studies, media studies, environmental studies,
            etc.) </p>
              <p class="body"> The required courses are Biology 125 and 243,
                Psychology 125, Nursing 110, and Physical Education 255, 290,
                373, 374, 375, and 390. The department recommends Physical Education
                394 and 398, Chemistry 121, Psychology 231 and completion of
                the biomedical concentration. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> Biomedical Studies Concentration </p>
              <p class="body"> The biomedical studies concentration consists
                of five courses and a senior capstone experience. All students
                must take a foundation course (Biology 123 or 243) depending
                on their course of study. In addition, students are required
                to choose one course from opportunities in each of three core
                components: 1) practical application; 2) experiential learning;
                and 3) ethical consideration. Within each of these three components
                there will be several choices to fulfill the requirement. Seminars
                and Interim courses may be included as they become available.
                See biomedical studies in this catalog for more details. </p>
              <p class="body"> The Physical Education Department offers the following
                courses that count toward the biomedical studies concentration:
                Physical Education 255 (Prevention and Care of Athletic Injuries),
                373 (Motor Learning), 374 (Biomechanics) and 375 (Exercise Physiology).
                    Also, many experiential components that support the biomedical
                    concentration (such as being a student athletic trainer or
                  interning at a sport medicine clinic) exist within the Physical
                  Education Department. </p>
              <p class="goldsubhead">Coaching Sequence </p>
              <p class="body"> It is highly recommended that students in all
                teaching majors who wish to be employed as a head varsity coach
                of an interscholastic sport in a senior high school successfully
                complete the following sequence of courses: Physical Education
                238, 255, 335, 374 and 375. Students not in the education teaching
                track are encouraged to enter the program if they are interested
                in becoming an assistant or head coach. A coaching sequence candidate
                must make application for acceptance to the program with the
                Physical Education Department (coaching sequence advisor). </p>
