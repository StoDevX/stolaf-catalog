              <p class="programdescription">Sociology and anthropology share the belief that
                society and culture shape us in powerful ways and that we can
                only know ourselves when we understand our social and cultural
                context. Our personalities and choices reflect who we are, but
                so do the groups and social institutions to which we belong (peers,
              family, religion, politics, occupations).</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology grew
                  out of efforts to understand the nature and problems of modern
                  industrial societies, while anthropology grew out of Europe&rsquo;s
                  encounters with diverse world cultures. Both seek to explain
                  the relationships among individuals, groups, institutions,
                  culture and meaning; both seek insights into the pressing personal
              and social issues of our day.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology and
                  anthropology contribute to current debates in politics, philosophy,
                  theology and other areas about multiculturalism, environment,
                  gender, inequality, &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; development,
                welfare reform, globalization and immigration. All require clear
                understanding of life&rsquo;s social and cultural dimensions.<br>
              Occupations drawing on sociological and anthropological knowledge
            include policy research and planning, human resources and industrial
            relations, public and international relations, law, medicine,
            ministry, counseling, education, management, social work and
            marketing. Both disciplines also help prepare students for social
            service and justice work. </p>

                  (Sociology/Anthropology 291, 292, 371, 372 or 373, 399) and
                  four elective courses, including at least one course from the
                  area and topical groups (230s, 240s, 250s) and one from the
                  social institutions group (260s).Transfer students are under
                  the same requirements as students in their graduating class.
                  Majors are also required to take Statistics 110 (offered by
                  the Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science Department).
                  Statistics 110 is best taken before or simultaneously with
                  Sociology/Anthropology 371. Students are permitted to take
                  one of the four elective courses, but not a core course, S/U.
                  An introductory course is not required but may be used as an

studies of Native American groups from the major culture areas of North America north of Mexico. Topics

                In many respects, products like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol
                and opium provide the glue that holds together modern life.
                This course examines the web of these substances from an anthropological
              perspective. Our focus includes the politics of production, the
              culturally diverse practices of consumption and the social consequences
              of regulation. Based on our collective experience at St. Olaf,
              we consider the mood-altering substances on and off campus and
              examine their influence in such things as our social identity,
              individual consciousness and the structure of authority. Offered

              In this course we will explore how jazz music and accompanying
                cultural forms have reflected as well as shaped American society
                and culture. Utilizing photographs, film, music and texts,
                we will examine how race, class and gender structured jazz,
                as well as politics, urbanization, migration and technology.
                We will look at jazz in terms of social deviance and as a social
                movement, including its relationship to slavery, segregation
                and African cultural roots. Offered Interim. </p>

  This course helps students explore the connections between society
                  and their own lives. Students answer challenging questions
                  such as &ldquo;Do we have a &lsquo;human nature&rsquo;?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
                  does social inequality exist?,&rdquo; &ldquo;What is race?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;How
                  do societies change?&rdquo; In answering these questions students
                  will learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing
                  so they will review the various research methods and theories

                through the social and cultural experience of food in local
                eateries and support themselves and their communities financially

              How do anthropologists study other cultures? Peoples around the
                world create different realities through the ways they conceptualize
                experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do
                what they need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe
                and compare cultures and societies, focusing on different aspects
                such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion
                and values, economy and technology, cultural and social change.
