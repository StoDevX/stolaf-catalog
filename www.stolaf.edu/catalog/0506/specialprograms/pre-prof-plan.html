            <p class="programname">Pre-Professional Preparation</p>
            <p class="body">The following roster of pre-professional studies
              indicates how the liberal arts can fulfill the general as well
              as the specialized objectives of St. Olaf students. Recommendations
              are based on the typical pre-professional requirements currently
            existing in universities and professional schools. </p>
            <p class="body"> Many other occupations beyond those in this roster
              may be pursued with a liberal arts background, of course. To learn
              more about them, call or visit the campus contact persons listed
              in areas that seem similar.<br>
    Subjects grouped under the headings &ldquo;Strongly Recommended&rdquo; are
    required by many institutions while those under &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; are
    important but not necessarily required. Because of their diverse nature, many
    professions such as business and management, law and public policy defy course-specific
    recommendations for undergraduates. For example, as many psychology as economics
    majors in the United States enter business careers each year through corporate
    training programs. In those instances, recommendations should be considered
    suggestive, not directive. Opposite examples are nursing and social work (consult
    the Index), which have prescribed curriculums required for licensure examinations. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">PRE-PROFESSIONAL STUDIES</p>
            <p class="body">              Students are encouraged to work closely with faculty, pre-professional

              elective courses in accounting and finance. Since 2000, new members
              of the American Institute of CPAs have been required to earn one
              year of college credit beyond the bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students
  are strongly advised to check the regulations for licensure in the state where
  they intend to practice. </p>
