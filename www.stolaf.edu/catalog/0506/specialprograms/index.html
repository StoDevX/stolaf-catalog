            <p class="programname">Education
              Put to Work
            </p>
            <p class="programdescription">The college is proud of its record of &ldquo;education put to
                work.&rdquo; Breadth in liberal arts study combined with depth
                in an academic major remains the most adaptable and enduring
                education for students anticipating productive lives in a rapidly
                changing world.</p>
            <p class="body"> A large percentage of St. Olaf graduates continue
              their education in America&rsquo;s best graduate and professional schools. According
                to the National Research Council&rsquo;s Survey of Earned Doctorates,
                St. Olaf ranks sixth among bachelor&rsquo;s degree colleges in
                the number of graduates who went on to earn doctoral degrees
                during the period 1991-2000. St. Olaf was first among baccalaureate
                colleges in mathematics, fourth in chemistry and sixth in life
                sciences as an undergraduate supplier of Ph.D.s during the same
                period. (It ranks 11th among all higher education institutions
                as a source of Ph.D.s in mathematics.)</p>
            <p class="body"> Many St. Olaf graduates enter university programs
              in medicine, law, the fine arts, business and management and government
              and public policy, as well as research programs in technologies
              not dreamed of a decade ago. Other graduates embrace the life and
              mission of the Church, teaching and careers in international
              service, outreach and travel. </p>
            <p class="body"> The college counsels patience, search and reflection
              in the preparation for future work. Some of the most successful
              academic programs and majors preparatory for careers are not decided
              until the end of the sophomore year, and college majors that seem
              unrelated to specific careers often prove extremely viable. It
              is noteworthy that many of the country&rsquo;s top business leaders were philosophy
                  or history majors. Today it is not uncommon to see chemistry
                  majors enter law school and English majors (with requisite health
                  science electives) admitted to medical school. </p>
            <p class="body">A number of factors contribute to the success of
              St. Olaf graduates, including an education that recognizes that
              as knowledge becomes increasingly less compartmentalized it will
              be those who have learned how to learn who will have the advantage.</p>
            <p class="body"> Through their regular coursework, innovative options
              like the Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum program (see Index),
              and the hands-on experience provided by independent study and research
              options, internships, and programs like the Finstad Office for
              Entrepreneurial Studies, students explore the interconnectedness
              of the world today &mdash; and prepare for life in the ever-changing
                world of <br>
            tomorrow. </p>
            <p class="body"> Guiding students in their explorations are the informed
              and caring men and women of the St. Olaf faculty and staff, who
              provide continuing support to students in a regular and resourceful
              program of search and guidance. A number of pre-professional studies
              programs also help them shape their studies to fit the requirements
              of America&rsquo;s top professional and graduate schools. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>
            <p class="subhead"> The Center for Experiential Learning </p>
            <p class="body"> The Center for Experiential Learning (CEL) was established
              in 2000 to fulfill the vision of providing every interested St.
              Olaf student with experiential learning opportunities that relate
              to and complement the St. Olaf liberal arts curriculum. Building
              on the educational strategy that students need to &ldquo;live
                their learning&rdquo; by creating bridges between classroom work
                and the world by &ldquo;the Hill,&rdquo; CEL programs focus on
                internships and service learning, career development and entrepreneurial
                studies. Programs are implements through the CEL&rsquo;s Offices
                for Career Connections, Internships, Servant Leadership and Entrepreneurial
                Studies with the intent of providing a coordinated, comprehensive,
                classroom-based experiential learning program that is academically
                sound, inclusive of all academic disciplines and connected with
                all sectors of the domestic and global communities. For in-depth
                information about these programs, visit <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel/">http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel/</a></p>
            <p class="body"><b>Career Connections</b> &mdash; The mission of
                  the Office for Career Connections is to assist students in
                  developing, implementing and evaluating career/life plans and
                  to educate faculty and staff regarding issues of career and
                  life planning. The career connections process emphasizes career
                  exploration, experiential learning and reflection through a
                  wide range of assessments, resources, services and programs
                throughout the campus community. </p>
              <p class="body"><b>Internships</b> &mdash; The Office for Internships
                  provides services and resources that assist students in exploring
                  and engaging in internahips and externships (job shadowing).
                  These experiential learning opportunities allow students to
                  apply their classroom theories and knowledge in a real world
                  setting, develop transferable skills, build a network of employer
                  contacts, assess strengths and evaluate career options as they
                  prepare for life beyond the campus. The office works to create
                  meaningful learning experiences by facilitating interactions
                between students, faculty, alumni and organizations.</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Entrepreneurial Studies</b> &mdash; The Finstad
                  Office for Entrepreneurial Studies, established in 1992 with
                  a major gift from Paul and Anne Finstad and other St. Olaf
                  alumni, promotes entrepreneurial thinking and action among
                  students, faculty and alumni of the college. Through a variety
                  of courses and activities in entrepreneurship, the Finstad
                  Office helps students prepare for roles as business owners
                  and managers, venture capitalists or consultants to smaller
                businesses, providing an unparalleled learning experience in
                entrepreneurial practice.</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Servant Leadership</b> &mdash; The mission of the Office for Servant
                Leadership is to build upon the rich heritage of St. Olaf College
                in developing servant leaders &mdash; students challenged to
                be responsible citizens of the world, concerned for the common
                good and bringing their gifts to the world. Through experiential
                learning, the Office for Servant Leadership continues to build
                a community of future servant leaders, supporting students in
                their desire to first serve and through that service to become
                agents for change. The office accordingly creates opportunities
                for students and faculty to connect academic experiences with
                practical, &ldquo;hand-on&rdquo; engagement in service by facilitating
                service-learning initiatives, campus and community engagement,
              civic dialogues and international study-service programs. </p>
