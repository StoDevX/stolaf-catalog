            <p class="goldhead">COURSE</p>
            <p class="body"> For numerical purposes, the term &ldquo;course&rdquo; 
              means a full (1.00) course credit, as distinguished from fractional 
              course credits.</p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf courses are not denominated in semester 
              or quarter credits. Each St. Olaf course is equivalent to 4.00 semester 
              credits or 5.00 quarter credits. </p>
            <p class="body"> Course descriptions are printed in this catalog or 
              in the Catalog Supplement. Course offerings during a given semester 
              are listed in the Class and Lab Schedules, which are published three 
              times a year. <br>
              Thirty-five full course credits are required for the Baccalaureate 
              degree. Unless reduced as the result of transfer credits, 24 of 
              the 35 courses must be taken on a graded basis. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">HALF-SEMESTER COURSES</p>
            <p class="body"> Half-semester courses have drop/add and S/U deadlines 
              that are different from full-semester courses. Consult the registrar&rsquo;s 
              calendar on the registrar&rsquo;s website. If a student is taking 
              a full load of 4.50 courses with the .50 being a first-half semester 
              course, he/she cannot register for a second-half semester course 
              unless he/she meets the criteria for an overload stated under &ldquo;Course 
              Loads&rdquo; in this catalog. </p>
            <p class="body"> Note that &ldquo;1&rdquo; designates a first-half 
              semester course and &ldquo;2&rdquo; a second-half course in the 
              Class and Lab Schedule. If there is a &ldquo;1&rdquo; next to the 
              Lab/Disc column, the course is offered during the first half of 
              the semester. If there is a &ldquo;2&rdquo; next to the Lab/Disc 
              column, the course is offered in the second half of <br>
              the semester. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">COURSE CREDITS</p>
            <p class="body"> Often credit earned from specific courses varies 
              with different Baccalaureate degrees, core requirements and majors. 
              Rely on the Class and Lab Schedules for information about which 
              courses fulfill General Education requirements. </p>
            <ol>
              <li> <span class="body">Performance studies courses are always Level 
                I when counted toward the Bachelor of Arts degree. Credit for 
                performance studies courses is counted as upper level (numbered 
                200 and above) in the principal performing medium for Bachelor 
                of Music degree students only during the junior and senior years. 
                </span></li>
              <li class="body"> Dance activity courses count toward the physical 
                activity requirement (PHA). </li>
              <li class="body"> A course may be repeated only once, only at St. 
                Olaf and only when the grade is C- or below, U or N. A course 
                cannot be repeated after satisfactory completion of any course 
                in the same department for which the course is considered a pre-requisite, 
                unless specifically required to graduate. A course may be repeated 
                S/U only if the course was originally taken S/U and a U was received. 
                If a course receives an S credit, it may not be repeated regardless 
                of the actual reported grade. A course may earn only one credit 
                once completed with a passing grade. Each course attempt remains 
                part of the permanent record, but only the second grade is computed 
                into the grade point average. </li>
              <li class="body"> After students have graduated with a degree, the 
                college will not accept additional courses transferred from other 
                colleges except two courses to complete an additional major. </li>
              <li class="body"> A student may not take an independent study for 
                a course regularly offered in a department of the college. Independent 
                study or research may count toward a major, but may not fulfill 
                a General Education requirement (except as a course with writing 
                [WRI]). </li>
              <li class="body"> Twenty-four of the 35 full courses required for 
                graduation must be taken on a graded basis unless that number 
                has been reduced by transfer or off-campus course work. </li>
              <li class="body"> A student must complete at least six courses with 
                grades of C or higher in a major in order to complete the major 
                requirement. A grade of C- or S does not count in fulfilling this 
                requirement. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="goldhead">COURSE LEVELS</p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf courses have levels designated by course 
              numbers in this catalog and in the Class and Lab Schedules as Level 
              I, II and III. </p>
            <p class="body"> Level I Courses, numbered 100 through 199, are for 
              the most part introductory to a field or discipline. They exert 
              a demand for only such depth of study, student responsibility and 
              independence commensurate with initial work at the college level.</p>
            <p class="body"> Level II Courses, numbered 200 through 299, require 
              student independence in the acquisition of material and mastery 
              of techniques and methods above that demanded in Level I courses.</p>
            <p class="body"> Level III Courses, numbered 300 through 399, are 
              usually confined to the major and demand control of methods as well 
              as command of basic factual and theoretical knowledge appropriate 
              to the discipline. A student should have at least two Level III 
              courses in the major.</p>
            <p class="body"> Courses numbered at Level II and Level III are referred 
              to as upper level courses. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students may be required to have at least two Level 
              III courses in their major. </p>
            <p class="body"> Eighteen of the 35 full course credits required for 
              graduation must be at Level II or III. </p>
            <p class="body"> A course can earn only one level. It cannot be raised 
              in level as the result of extra studies, assignments, or performance. 
              A course with a lower number cannot, as the result of extra work, 
              become another course of a higher number because of scheduling conflicts 
              or closed course status. For example, Art 119 (.50) cannot earn 
              credit as Art 233 (1.00), nor can Art 233 become 244. Likewise, 
              a .25 credit course cannot become a .50 credit course. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">COURSE LOADS AND COSTS/OVERLOADS</p>
            <p class="body"> To be considered full-time, a student must be registered 
              for at least 3.00 course credits. Students receiving veterans benefits 
              need 3.00 course credits to be considered full-time. Four full-credit 
              semester credits are required to maintain certain forms of State 
              of Minnesota financial aid. </p>
            <p class="body"> 4.5 credits is the typical, maximum course load allowed 
              from all sources during a semester and only one course may be taken 
              during Interim. Note that a student cannot add a course so as to 
              create a course overload; a course must be dropped first if an added 
              course would put the student's course load over the allowed 4.5 
              credits maximum. </p>
            <p class="body"> If a student is taking a full load of 4.50 credits 
              with the .50 being a first-half semester course, he/she cannot register 
              for a second-half semester course unless he/she meets the criteria 
              for an overload, below.</p>
            <p class="body"> With the permission of the registrar, a student may 
              exceed 4.5 credits during a semester if:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> The student is a senior, for whom the maximum 
                load is 5.00 full credits during one semester of the senior year. 
                The senior year is defined as the two semesters prior to Commencement 
                either as a &ldquo;participator&rdquo; (see &ldquo;Participation 
                in Graduation,&rdquo; page 57) or as a diploma graduate. </li>
              <li class="body"> The student is a junior or a sophomore and normally 
                has a 3.60 grade point average over the nine most recent, full 
                St. Olaf courses. The student may thereby take up to the maximum

            <p class="goldhead">FINAL EXAMINATIONS</p>
            <p class="body"> A final exam is required for all courses and a special 
              time is reserved in exam week for every course&rsquo;s exam. Teachers 
              may plan an in-class exam for that period or arrange other means 
              of evaluation brought to the final meeting of the class at the latest 
              (i.e., a take-home exam, a final paper, etc.). In any case, students 
              must attend the scheduled final exam meeting, whether it is a traditional 
              exam or a special, final meeting of the class. Absence will be reported 
              to the appropriate student dean by the instructor and results in 
              failure of the final exam or the course at the discretion of the 
              instructor.</p>
            <p class="body"> Except for courses in performance studies, physical 
              activity and dance activity, an instructor may not use the last 
              day of class for either a written or oral final exam. Take-home 
              exams and papers substituting for final exams must be due at the 
              scheduled final exam period.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students are required to take final exams at the 
              scheduled time unless the instructor, with the written approval 
              of the department chair or program director, has given the student 
              permission to re-schedule to another time during finals week. Student 
              requests for an exam change must be made in writing. The decision 
              rests with the chair or director. Chairs and directors will exclude 
              from consideration rescheduling requests involving rides home, early 
              family vacations, early summer employment, pre-purchased airline 
              tickets and the like. The Student Honor Council welcomes policy 
              that restricts the number of schedule exceptions during finals week.</p>

            <p class="goldhead">GRADE CHANGES</p>
            <p class="body"> A student has one year to notify the Registrar&rsquo;s

            <p class="body"> Grade changes, on the other hand, are initiated by 
              the instructor issuing the original grade. The intended purpose 
              of the grade change procedure is to correct an instructor&rsquo;s 
              computational or other error in reporting a grade, not to represent 
              additional work on the part of the student. The instructor (both 
              instructors of a team-taught course) submits a grade change request 
              to the registrar for consideration. If the request is approved, 
              the Registrar&rsquo;s Office informs both the student and the instructor.

              Olaf, or if credit is earned through special programs such as Advanced 
              Placement. As a rule, two-thirds of the courses taken at St. Olaf 
              must be graded. The graded course requirement is reduced by scale 
              in the following instances:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> Credits transferred into St. Olaf from another

                not reduce the number of graded course credits required for graduation. 
                This rule applies to students who matriculate at St. Olaf before 
                going on a non-St. Olaf off-campus program.</li>

              taught by a St. Olaf instructor on an off-campus program is considered 
              a graded course and counts toward the 24 required if taken for a

            <p class="goldhead">INCOMPLETES</p>
            <p class="body"> An incomplete in a course is rarely granted and only 
              if there is a distinct possibility of, and a commitment to, finishing 
              the course in a timely manner.</p>
            <p class="body"> A request for an incomplete is initiated by the student 
              and submitted to of the deans of students. Incompletes are granted 
              primarily for documented medical reasons and may not be issued by 
              an instructor without prior approval of the dean of students or 
              one of the associate deans of students. </p>
            <p class="body"> An incomplete for which a grade is not recorded by 
              the extended deadline set at the time of approval of the incomplete 
              automatically becomes an F. The incompleted course cannot be dropped 
              from the record at a later date to avoid a failing grade. Once the 
              course is completed with the assignment of a letter grade and credit, 
              an asterisk is entered beside it on the permanent transcript indicating 
              that the course was once incomplete. A student may not apply for 
              an incomplete in a course added after the posted deadline because 
              of insufficient time to complete the assigned work. </p>
            <p class="body"> A student who has been granted an incomplete in a 
              course cannot subsequently finish the course with similar course 
              credit transferred from another college. A St. Olaf incomplete that 
              is not completed at <br>
              St. Olaf will be converted into an F following the extended deadline 
              set at the time of approval of the incomplete. A student with an 
              incomplete on his/her academic record may participate in Commencement 
              if all other requirements for graduation have been met (see page 
              57). Only after a final grade has been recorded for the course, 
              however, will a degree be conferred and a diploma issued.</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="change-red">Only in the most extraordinary circumstances are incompletes 
              allowed on St. Olaf abroad programs<br>
              not led by a St. Olaf faculty member. Many non-U.S. colleges and 
              universities are not familiar with the<br>
              practice of giving incompletes, and constraints having to do with 
              distance and time make it very difficult<br>
              to follow up on incompletes. Consequently, students should not anticipate 
              being able to avail<br>
              themselves of this option.</span></p>
            <p class="goldhead">MUSIC</p>
            <p class="body"> Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Music major 
              and the degree requirements for the Bachelor of Music are defined 
              only in this catalog. Students should also consult the Music Handbook. 
              Bachelor of Arts Music and Music Education majors should be careful 
              to complete 21 credits outside of the major. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">MUSICAL ORGANIZATIONS</p>
            <p class="body"> Student participation in campus musical organizations 
              (choirs, orchestras, bands, ensembles, etc.) is not awarded course 
              credit. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">PERFORMANCE STUDIES COURSES</p>
            <p class="body"> Performance studies courses (music lessons) are always 
              Level I courses for Bachelor of Arts students.<br>
              Performance studies courses (lessons) are upper level courses for 
              Bachelor of Music students only in their principal performing medium 
              and only during the junior and senior years.</p>
            <p class="body"> Generally, performance studies courses are fractional 
              (.25) courses, not full credit courses. Registration for performance 
              studies courses must be approved by the Music Department. Registration 
              instructions are published in the Class and Lab Schedule. Lessons 
              may be added to or dropped from a student&rsquo;s registration only 
              with a music lesson drop/add slip available from the Music Office. 
              This drop/add slip must be processed by the Music Department academic 
              administrative assistant before it will be accepted in the Registrar&rsquo;s 
              Office.</p>
            <p class="body"> Registration for performance studies lessons may 
              result in an additional fee; see the Music Office for details. If 
              a student drops a performance studies course (lessons) after the 
              first day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">P/N COURSES (PASS/NO-PASS GRADES)</p>
            <p class="body"> P/N credits are earned in courses that are offered 
              only P/N. In other words, every student taking the course is doing 
              so on an ungraded basis. This differs from S/U grades where each 
              student in a course may elect to take the course graded or ungraded. 
              Courses offered only on the P/N basis, if so designated, may fulfill 
              General Education graduation requirements. </p>
