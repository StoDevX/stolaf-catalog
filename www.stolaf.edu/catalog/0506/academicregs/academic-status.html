            <p class="body"> Classification is based on the number of St. Olaf 
              total credits completed by and only on October 1, as follows:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="body"> Sophomore: 6-14 credits<br>
                Junior: 15-22 credits<br>
                Senior: 23- credits </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body">Because reclassification is completed only once each 
              year, it is important that all work completed at another institution 
              be transferred to St. Olaf before the reclassification process begins. 
              A student&rsquo;s classification may affect &ldquo;room draw,&rdquo;

            <p class="goldhead">DEAN&rsquo;S LIST</p>
            <p class="body"> Each semester, the Registrar&rsquo;s Office compiles 
              for the Office of the Dean of the College a Dean&rsquo;s List, which 
              includes the names of all students with a GPA of 3.75 or above for 
              that semester. In order to be named to the Dean&rsquo;s List, students 
              must have successfully completed three or more graded full credits 
              in the semester.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Distinction</p>
            <p class="body"> Each department and interdisciplinary program may 
              award distinction to selected graduating senior majors or concentrators. 
              Distinction is awarded upon completion of all graduation requirements.</p>
            <p class="body"> The faculty members of the department or program 
              determine the criteria for distinction in accordance with guidelines 
              established by the special studies sub-committee of the curriculum 
              and educational policies committee and administered by the registrar; 
              interested students should contact the appropriate department or 
              program for more information. Not every candidate automatically 
              receives distinction. </p>
            <p class="body"> A student may receive distinction in more than one 
              major or concentration if the student completes separate projects, 
              one for each major or concentration. A single project may suffice 
              if the project or thesis conforms to all relevant departments&rsquo; 
              or programs&rsquo; guidelines and constraints described for distinction. 
              A project or thesis being proposed for distinction in more than 
              one department or program must be approved in advance by all relevant 
              departments or programs.</p>
            <p class="body"> Each department or program submits to the registrar 
              the titles of all distinction projects or theses and the names of 
              all students who have been awarded distinction. Indication of distinction 
              appears in the commencement program and on the academic transcript. 
              It does not appear on the diploma.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">HONORS</p>
            <p class="body"> Honors are determined by the cumulative grade point 
              average. They are recognized at Honors Day, conferred at Commencement 
              and recorded on the final transcript and the diploma as:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="body"> 3.30 &mdash; cum laude<br>
                3.60 &mdash; magna cum laude<br>
                3.85 &mdash; summa cum laude</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body"> In determining honors, a grade point average is never 
              rounded up or down. Honor designations are not recorded on student 
              transcripts prior to graduation from the college. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">HONORS DAY</p>
            <p class="body"> On Honors Day each May, students are recognized in 
              three categories: Seniors elected to Phi Beta Kappa, special honors 
              and general honors by class. General honors includes all full-time 
              students who have a cumulative grade point average of 3.30 or higher. 
              <br>
              The names of the honorees are posted on the World Wide Web at least 
              three weeks prior to Honors Day.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">HONOR SOCIETIES</p>
            <p class="body"> Standards for election to Phi Beta Kappa and other 
              honor societies are the prerogative of the honor societies, not 
              the college.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">CLASS RANK </p>
            <p class="body"> Each graduated senior is ranked in his/her class 
              according to cumulative grade point averages (G.P.A.). Class rank 
              is recorded on the permanent transcript for those students whose 
              names appear in the Commencement program in May of a given year.</p>
            <p class="body"> Participators in Commencement are ranked according 
              to their cumulative G.P.A. after Spring Semester of the senior year. 
              Rank is not changed even if further St. Olaf course work is used 
              to complete degree requirements or used by diploma graduates for 
              additional credits.</p>
            <p class="body"> Class rank is also computed for non-seniors at the 
              end of each academic year, but is not recorded on the transcript. 
              Class rank is available upon request at the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. 
              Picture identification is required.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">ACADEMIC PROBATION</p>
            <p class="body"> This policy is effective for all students entering 
              St. Olaf on or after August 15, 2004.</p>
            <p class="body"> A student may be placed on academic probation, or 
              be continued on probation, with:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> A cumulative grade point average of 1.80 or below 
                in the first year, 1.90 or below in the sophomore year and 2.00 
                in the junior and senior year, or </li>
              <li class="body"> Two or more grades of D, F, N, or U in any semester, 
                or </li>
              <li class="body"> Fewer than two and one-half courses of C- or better 
                during a semester, or fewer than five and one-half courses of 
                C- or better during an academic year. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="body">Parents of financially dependent or consenting students 
              are notified when students are placed on academic probation.</p>
            <p class="body"> A student on probation may not participate in an 
              Interim Exchange program. Students may apply to a St. Olaf-sponsored 
              off-campus program while they are on probation, but ordinarily a 
              student who remains on academic probation may not participate in 
              an off-campus program. Approval by the director of International 
              and Off-Campus Studies is required for a student on academic probation 
              to participate in an off-campus program. Students on academic probation 
              may not serve in an executive role in a student organization, and 
              students continuing on probation may be asked further to curtail 
              extra-curricular activities. Institutionally controlled gift assistance 
              or financial aid may be reduced if a student is placed on academic 
              probation. <br>
              College decisions involving probation are not subject to appeal. 
            </p>
            <p class="goldhead">ACADEMIC DISMISSAL</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="change-red">This policy is effective for all students entering 
              St. Olaf on or after August 15, 2004.</span></p>
            <p class="body">A student may be dismissed if he/she is on probationary 
              status and fails to achieve minimal academic progress. Minimal academic 
              progress is defined as that combination of course completions and 
              grade points that suggest the probable completion of graduation 
              requirements in four years with at least a 2.00 cumulative grade

            <p class="body">Normally a student will not be considered for dismissal 
              unless s/he has been on probation for at least one semester. The 
              college reserves the right, under extraordinary circumstances, however, 
              to dismiss a student who has not been on probation.</p>
            <p class="body"> There is usually a waiting period of one year prior 
              to consideration of an application for readmission following dismissal.</p>
            <p class="body"> Decisions resulting in academic dismissal or the 
              placement of a student on academic probation are made by the Academic 
              Standing Committee, which includes the faculty member serving as 
              associate dean of students (chair), the other two class deans, the 
              associate registrar, the coordinator of the Academic Advising Center, 
              the coordinator of Student Disability Services, the director of 
              Student Support Services, rhe director of the Academic Support Center, 
              the director of Multicultural Affairs and Community Outreach and 
              one member of the faculty, appointed by the faculty member serving 
              as associate dean of students.</p>
            <p class="body"> Parents of financially dependent or consenting students 
              are notified when academic dismissal occurs. <br>
              Students placed in dismissal status may appeal the dismissal decision 
              to an appeals board composed of the dean of the college, the dean 
              of students and the registrar. The appeal must be made in writing 
              and sent to the registrar within seven days of the date of receipt 
              of the dismissal letter. The decision of the appeals board is final.<br>
