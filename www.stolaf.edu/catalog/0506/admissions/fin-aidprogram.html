            <p class="programname">Financial Aid Program</p>
            <p class="body"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/financial_aid/" class="url">http://www.stolaf.edu/services/financial_aid/</a> </p>
            <p class="body">The financial aid program at St. Olaf College has
              one primary objective: to make it possible for qualified young
              men and women to obtain an education at St. Olaf. The college operates
              on the premise that all students admitted to St. Olaf and in good
              academic standing are worthy of financial assistance to attend
            St. Olaf if financial need is demonstrated. </p>
            <p class="body"> The responsibility for financing a St. Olaf education
              rests first with the student and his or her family. All new students
              who wish to apply for financial aid must complete the College Scholarship
              Service (CSS) PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student
              Aid (FAFSA). Returning students must complete the FAFSA and the
              St. Olaf Application for Financial Aid. Using a standardized formula,
              these documents generate, on the basis of the family&rsquo;s financial
    situation, the amount of the student&rsquo;s annual educational expenses
    the family is expected to meet. That amount is the &ldquo;expected family
    contribution.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="body"> &ldquo;Demonstrated need&rdquo; is the difference between the annual educational
    expenses at St. Olaf College and the expected family contribution. Demonstrated
    need is the basis on which St. Olaf financial aid is awarded. The college will
    provide each student with a financial aid package of scholarship, grants, loans,
    and/or student work to meet 100 percent of the demonstrated need. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">STUDENT FINANCIAL AID</p>
            <p class="body"> Only full-time students who
              are degree candidates at St. Olaf College in their first eight
              semesters are eligible for financial assistance from the college.
              Students enrolled for a ninth or tenth semester are not eligible
              for most grant programs and will have larger loan components in
            a fifth year of enrollment. </p>
            <p class="body"> Financial aid is credited directly to the student&rsquo;s
              comprehensive fee account. Financial aid is credited on an equal
            basis for the Fall Semester and the Spring Semester.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students on academic probation may not be eligible
              to receive scholarship assistance from St. Olaf or federal or state
            financial aid during the probationary period. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress
              (SAP) for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs.
              For more information on SAP policies at St. Olaf, contact the Office
              of Financial Aid.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">THE ENDOWMENT ADVANTAGE </p>
            <p class="body"> The endowment at St. Olaf (which had a market value
              of over <span class="change-red">$200</span> million in <span class="change-red">2004</span>) consists of funds contributed to
              St. Olaf by alumni, parents, faculty, staff, corporations, foundations,
              and other friends of the college. The income from those contributions
              is applied to &mdash; among other programs &mdash; grants,
      scholarships, and faculty research and travel. </p>
            <p class="body"> Thanks to the endowment and other annual financial
              support, every student attending St. Olaf &mdash; whether receiving financial aid or not &mdash; benefits from
      an indirect form of financial assistance. Endowment earnings and annual gifts
      help support the operating budget of the college and allow St. Olaf to keep
      tuition charges at roughly 75 percent of the actual cost. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SCHOLARSHIPS </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf scholarships are available to incoming
              first-year students, transfers, and returning students. Eligibility
              for a St. Olaf scholarship is based on demonstrated need, other
              financial aid, scholastic standing, activity record, test scores,
              recommendations, and full-time enrollment. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>National Merit Scholarships:</b> Applicants who have
              designated St. Olaf College as their first-choice college with
              the National Merit Scholarship Corporation are eligible for the
              St. Olaf National Merit Scholarship award. St. Olaf sponsors up
              to 40 Merit Scholarships each year for incoming students. The minimum
              annual award is $7,500. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Other Merit-Based Scholarships:</b> St. Olaf also awards
              scholarships through programs such as the Buntrock Academic Scholarship
              and the Award for Service and Leadership. For information on how
              to apply for these programs, please contact the Office of Admission
              at (507) 646-3025 or (800) 800-3025, or e-mail to admissions@stolaf.edu. </p>
            <p class="body">Buntrock Academic Scholarships range from $2,000
              to $9,000 per year. The awards are renewable for each of the recipient&rsquo;s
            four years at St. Olaf. </p>
            <p class="body"> Many schools that offer merit and talent scholarships
              prescribe strict criteria with respect to a high school G.P.A.,
              test scores, class rank, etc. We have found that such prescriptions
              often discourage very successful students from competing. As such,
              we are inclined to respect the differences among high schools and
              not list a set of minimum criteria for scholarship candidates.            </p>
            <p class="body"> Eligibility for Buntrock awards is based primarily
              on academic performance in high school, and the selection is highly
              competitive. Past recipients have generally presented a high school
              G.P.A. of 3.6 or higher and are often in the top five percent of
              their high school graduating class. Evidence of participation in
              extracurricular activities in addition to academic performance
            is valued. </p>
            <p class="body"> Recipients of Buntrock awards may be designated
              a Regents Scholar or a Presidential Scholar. Up to 70 students
              will be selected as finalists for the Regents award &mdash; our
    top academic scholarship &mdash; and are invited to campus for a series of
    programs and faculty interviews in March. </p>
            <p class="body"> Candidates who are not selected to interview on
              campus will automatically be considered for a presidential or deans&rsquo; award and will be notified of
      the committee&rsquo;s decision in mid-March. </p>
            <p class="body"> In addition to completing a St. Olaf application 
              for admission, candidates must complete and return the Buntrock 
              academic scholarship application no later than February 1 of the 
              senior year. Candidates who wish to be considered for the Buntrock 
              Regent scholarship must apply under Early Action, completing their 
              application no later than December <span class="change-red">1 </span><span class="change-strikethrough">15</span> 
              of the senior year. Only those candidates who also wish to be considered 
              for need-based financial aid programs must file the CSS PROFILE 
              form. </p>
            <p class="body">The St. Olaf Awards for Service and Leadership recognize
              the talents and abilities of those students who have given significant
              time and effort for the benefit of others. Students who have been
              involved in community service activities, either on a personal
              level or as part of a larger group, are encouraged to apply for
              this service award. Applicants for this award should have a complete
              St. Olaf Application for Admission and a St. Olaf Award for Service
              and Leadership application on file by February <span class="change-red">1</span> <span class="change-strikethrough">15</span> of the senior
              year. <span class="change-strikethrough">We ask that you provide us with a recommendation from an
              individual who has supervised your activities in this area.</span> In
              addition, applicants are encouraged to submit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; detailing
              their community service involvement, including types of activities
              and length of service. <br>

              at least 3.75 courses per semester or 2.75 courses each semester
              and an Interim course. Students who are enrolled in fewer hours
              during the school year will experience significant reductions in
              State Grant amounts. </p>

            <p class="body"> <b>Federal Perkins Loan Program:</b> Long-term loans for
              students who demonstrate financial need are available through the
              federal Perkins loan program. The amounts vary, but cannot exceed
            <span class="change-red">$4,000 </span><span class="change-strikethrough">$3,500</span> per year. </p>
            <p class="body"> No interest is charged nor is repayment required
              while the borrower is enrolled as at least a half-time student.
              Simple interest of five percent and repayment begin nine months
              after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than
              half-time. Repayment must be completed within 10 years. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized
                and Unsubsidized)</b>              Many families qualify for a subsidized federal Stafford loan, which
              can provide up to $2,625 per year for first-year students, $3,500
              for second-year students and up to $5,500 for third- and fourth-year
              students. <br>
  Eligibility is based on demonstrated need. Factors such as the number of persons
  in the family and the number of children in college affect eligibility. </p>
            <p class="body">Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized) and (Unsubsidized)
              can be secured from banks and savings and loan associations. Applications
              may be obtained from private lenders or from the St. Olaf financial
              aid office. A student may borrow up to $23,000 in Stafford loans
              as an undergraduate. Stafford loans are subject to a three percent
              origination fee and a one percent guarantee fee, although many
            lenders will pay the guarantee fee for the student borrowers. </p>
            <p class="body"> For a subsidized Stafford loan, the federal government
              pays the interest during the in-school period. For an unsubsidized
              Stafford loan, the interest during the in-school period is at a
              rate equal to the 91-day T-bill rate plus 1.7% (<span class="change-red">4.7%</span> <span class="change-strikethrough">2.82%</span> as of July
            <span class="change-red">2005</span> <span class="change-strikethrough"> 2003</span>), with a maximum of 8.25%. </p>
            <p class="body"> During re-payment, the interest rate for both subsidized
              and unsubsidized Stafford loans is at a rate equal to the 91-day
              T-bill rate plus 2.3% (<span class="change-red">5.3%</span> <span class="change-strikethrough">3.42%</span> as of July <span class="change-red">2005</span> <span class="change-strikethrough">2003</span>), again with a maximum
              of 8.25%. Repayment begins six months after a student ceases to
              be at least a half-time student and repayment is normally completed
              according to a 10-year amortization schedule. For those students
              who borrow about $4,000 or less, the minimum monthly payments of
      $50 will be required, but will result in a repayment period shorter than
      10 years. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Student Educational Loan Fund
                (SELF):</b> Student educational
              loans are available to St. Olaf students irrespective of need.
              The maximum SELF loan is $4,500 per year for first- and second-year
              students and $6,000 for third- and fourth-year students. These
              loans, made available by the Minnesota Higher Education Services
              Office (MHESO), carry a variable interest rate (generally 6-8 percent).
              Interest is charged and paid quarterly during &ldquo;in-school&rdquo; periods.
              Monthly &ldquo;interest-only&rdquo; payments are expected in the
              first year following the completion of a student&rsquo;s schooling.
              Monthly payments toward interest and principal begin on the first
              anniversary of the completion of school. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>Parent Loan for Undergraduate
                Students (PLUS):</b> Parent
              loan for undergraduate students (PLUS) is a program open to the
              parents of all St. Olaf students. PLUS funds can be secured from
              banks and from savings and loan associations. Applications are
              available from participating lenders. The PLUS program is guaranteed
              by the federal government and is insured against the death of the
            borrower. </p>
            <p class="body"> Parents may borrow up to the cost of education minus 
              financial aid received. The interest rate on PLUS is the lower of 
              nine percent or refinanced variable interest rate of T-bill plus 
              3.1 percent. (The rate <span class="change-red">will be 6.1%</span> 
              <span class="change-strikethrough">was 4.22 percent</span> in <span class="change-red">2005-06</span> <span class="change-strikethrough">2003-04</span>.) 
              PLUS loans are subject to a four percent origination fee and guarantee 
              fee. Repayment on PLUS loans begins within 60 days after receipt 
              of loan proceeds and can be extended over 10 years. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">STUDENT WORK </p>
            <p class="body"> More than one-half of the students at St. Olaf work
            on campus part-time. </p>
            <p class="body"> Need-based, part-time work on campus traditionally
              has offered students the opportunity to help defray their college
              expenses and gain useful work experience. Recognizing that many
              people value the chance to contribute to their education, the college
                attempts to make student work opportunities available to every
    St. Olaf student who wishes to work. Priority will continue to be given,
                however, to those students who demonstrate financial need and
            receive student work as a component of their financial aid award.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students are paid a wage of $7.15 per hour or more,
              depending on the job. The maximum yearly contract of about $2,300
              for no more than 10 hours of work per week is not a guarantee a
              student will earn a specified amount through campus employment.
              Rather, it is a maximum amount a student has the potential to earn.
              Student work on campus usually includes assignments in the cafeteria,
              the library, residence halls and academic, athletic or administrative
              departments. </p>
            <p class="body"> Specific work assignments are made by the student
              work coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid. New students are
              notified of their assignments when they arrive on campus. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">RENEWAL OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE </p>
            <p class="body"> Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis and
              may be renewed to eligible students upon application. The St. Olaf
              application must be submitted by April 15 each year. The FAFSA
              must be completed and forwarded to the processing center by April
              15 each year. The amount of the renewal award will be based on
              demonstrated financial need. Renewal applications are considered
            in the same manner as new applications. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students may obtain information and applications
              from the Office of Financial Aid. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS </p>
            <p class="body"> Students falling below minimum academic standards
              set by St. Olaf College or a student placed on academic probation
              status for more than two semesters will not be eligible to receive
              federal financial aid unless documented and extenuating reasons
            for poor performance can be provided. </p>
