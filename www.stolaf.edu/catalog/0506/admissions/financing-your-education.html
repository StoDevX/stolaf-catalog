            <p class="goldhead">SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNT </p>
            <p class="body"> All accounts are expected to be paid according to
              the schedule noted above. Any variation from this schedule shall
            be arranged with Student Accounts. </p>
            <p class="body"> On accounts carried beyond September 30 for first
              semester amounts due, and beyond February 28 for second semester
              amounts due, a finance charge of one percent per month (equivalent

            for a preceding semester has not been paid in full. </p>
            <p class="body"> Money due a student from loans or scholarships is
              applied on the student&rsquo;s
          account and is not given in cash unless the account is paid in full. Work earnings

          upon designation on the basis of actual hours worked less taxes.</p>
            <p class="body"> The college reserves the right to withhold statements
              of honorable dismissal, transcripts of courses and grades or diplomas
              until all college bills have been paid, or until satisfactory arrangements

            <p class="goldhead">REFUND POLICY </p>
            <p class="body"> Tuition, room, board and fees refunds for anyone
              leaving within five weeks after the beginning date of any semester
              will be determined according to the following graduated scale:            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="body"> One week or less &#8212; 90% refund <br>
                Two weeks or less &#8212; 80% refund <br>
                Three weeks or less &#8212; 60% refund <br>
                Four weeks or less &#8212; 40% refund <br>
                Five weeks or less &#8212; 20% refund <br>
                Over five weeks &#8212; No refund </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="body">After five weeks, no refunds will be made on tuition.
              Room and board refunds will be prorated based on the number of
              weeks of attendance. Students who withdraw for medical reasons
              may receive a pro-rated refund of tuition throughout the semester
              and may be asked to provide the Dean of Students Office with documentation
            from a health-care provider. </p>
            <p class="body"> Refund of Interim charges in case of withdrawal
              will be calculated on a similar basis with two days of an Interim
              equivalent to one week of a semester. In those cases where a change
              is made in courses involving a charge, the above scale will also
              apply. No refunds in fees will be made for absences from private
    lessons, except on account of illness of more than two weeks&rsquo; duration.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students dismissed because of unsatisfactory work
              or infringement of college rules will receive refunds as determined
            by the administration. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students who enroll for the academic year but who
              elect to omit an Interim are not eligible for tuition or room credit/refund
              for the Interim. They may apply for an Interim board refund. Refunds
              will not be given for absences of less than seven consecutive days.
              The board refund request form (available in the Student Accounts
              Office) must be filed by the student before he or she leaves for
            Interim. If not filled out at that time, no refund will be given.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students who attend St. Olaf for Fall Semester only,
              Fall Semester and Interim only, Interim and Spring Semester only,
              or Spring Semester only will be charged half of the annual tuition.
              Room and board will be prorated to reflect the partial-year enrollment. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">The Withdrawal Process</p>
            <p class="body"> In order to begin the withdrawal process, a student
              must contact the Dean of Students Office (verbally or in writing)
              to begin the paperwork necessary to withdraw or take a leave of
              absence from St. Olaf. For the purposes of comprehensive fee refunds
              and financial aid refunds, the date of withdrawal is established
              as the date the student notifies the Dean of Students Office of
              his/her plans to withdraw. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Federal Financial Aid Refunds</p>
            <p class="body"> If the student withdraws before completing 60% of
              the semester, federal regulations require a return of Title IV
              financial aid if a student received financial assistance from the
              Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal
              Stafford Loan (subsidized or unsubsidized) and/or the Federal PLUS
      Loan program. The percentage of Title IV aid to be returned is equal to
              the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by
              the number of calendar days in the semester. Scheduled breaks of
            more than four consecutive days are excluded. </p>
            <p class="body"> If any funds are to be returned after the return
              of Title IV aid, they will be used to repay St. Olaf funds, state
              funds, other private sources and the student in proportion to the
              amount received from each non-federal source, as long as there
              was no unpaid balance at the time of withdrawal. If there was an
              unpaid balance, then all aid sources will be repaid before any
              funds are returned to the student. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Institutional Financial Aid Refunds</p>
            <p class="body"> If a student is receiving only St. Olaf gift funds,
              the amount of reduction of the scholarship and grant funds will
              be pro-rated, reflecting the percentage of the comprehensive fee
              refunded. For example, if 40% of the comprehensive fee is refunded,
              40% of scholarships and grants will be refunded. </p>
