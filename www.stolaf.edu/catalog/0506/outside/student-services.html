            <p class="body">              The St. Olaf College Student Support
              Services (SSS) program is a college retention program funded by
              the U.S. Department of Education and St. Olaf College. Funding
              from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, facilitated by the St.
              Olaf College Biology Department, provides primary funding for the
              five-week SSS Summer Bridge Program. The SSS program is one of
              three TRIO programs originally funded under the Higher Education
              Act of 1965, whose objective is to help students overcome class,
              social and cultural barriers to complete their college education.
                SSS provides the following services: academic advising/referral;
    cultural events and leadership activities; financial aid advising; graduate
    school preparation; incentive program for acadmic achievement; research,
    internship and scholarship opportunities; supplemental instruction (SI);
    and calculator and laptop lending program.</p>
            <p class="body"> To be eligible for services, a participant must

              degree), must meet federal income guidelines or have a documented
              disability. The SSS program provides services to approximately
