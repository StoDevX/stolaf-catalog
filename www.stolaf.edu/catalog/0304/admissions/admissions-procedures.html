        <p class="body">St. Olaf encourages applications from all interested persons 
          and seeks to assemble a student body which reflects a variety of geographic, 
          cultural, economic, racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds. We seek 
          to fill each class with a diverse and energetic group of students who 
          are eager to undertake the challenges of a liberal arts education. We 
          admit those we believe will have a successful experience and in determining 
          admission we consider academic achievement, academic aptitude and personal 
          qualifications as well as leadership and significant involvement in 
          school and community. </p>
        <p class="body">If you have questions about the application process please 
          contact the Admissions Office at (800) 800-3025. Many students find 
          a campus visit helpful in their search for a college. If you would like 
          information about scheduling a campus visit, please contact the campus 
          visit coordinator at 800-ASKOLAF (800) 275-6523. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">RECOMMENDED PREPARATION</span></p>
        <p class="body">A secondary school program combining breadth and depth 
          is an excellent preparation for study at St. Olaf. Advanced Placement 
          or enriched courses, when available, are particularly helpful. We recommend 
          a program of study that includes the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="body">Four years of English; </li>
          <li class="body">Three to four years of mathematics; </li>
          <li class="body">Two to three years of natural science; </li>
          <li class="body">Three to four years of social studies; and </li>
          <li class="body">Two to three years of the same second language, including 
            study in the senior year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">We advise students to pursue an academically rigorous 
          high school program that emphasizes creativity, writing and critical 
          analysis. Analytic and quantitative skills developed in such courses 
          as trigonometry and pre-calculus are important for all students. In 
          addition, we encourage students to take academic electives such as computer 
          science, economics, the fine arts, geography, journalism, sociology, 
          speech and world history. Keyboarding, word processing, health and physical 
          education, while valued, are not substitutes for academic subjects. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Students who have not pursued the program of studies suggested 
          above but who are looking for a challenging academic program are encouraged 
          to arrange to meet with an admissions representative. Careful attention 
          is given to each application and explanations of special circumstances 
          are appreciated. St. Olaf offers entry-level courses designed to meet 
          the diverse needs and qualifications of entering students. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Application Requirements </span><br>
          In making admission decisions, each application is reviewed on its merits, 
          without regard to financial need. Applicants to St. Olaf must submit:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">A $35 application fee. </li>
          <li class="body">The St. Olaf Application for Admission, available from 
            the Admissions Office, or the Common Application, available from high 
            school guidance offices or online at www.stolaf.edu/admissions/onlineapp. 
            (St. Olaf is among the colleges that accept the Common Application 
            (CA) form, either paper or on-line. Students using the CA are assured 
            of the same consideration given to applicants who use the St. Olaf 
            form. St. Olaf applicants using the Common Application must also submit 
            the St. Olaf Common Application Supplement which is available from 
            the Admissions Office.) </li>
          <li class="body">An official transcript from an accredited high school 
            or equivalent (see below). This transcript should include grades as 
            follows:

              <li><b>Early Decision:</b> Through the junior year</li>
              <li><b>Early Action:</b> Through first quarter or first trimester

                of the senior year</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="body">Scores from either the American College Test (ACT) 
            or the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT1) (see below). Please consult 
            the Admissions Office if you have any questions. </li>
          <li class="body">Two letters of recommendation from teachers of academic 
            subjects. Candidates are also welcome to submit personal recommendations 
            from coaches, music instructors, pastors and others who know the candidate 
            well, but such recommendations are optional.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT</span> </p>
        <p class="body">An official transcript of the high school academic record 
          should be sent by the high school to the Office of Admissions. The transcript 
          must show the record of completed high school work, rank in class (where 
          provided) and aptitude test scores. This transcript should include grades 
          as follows: </p>
        <p class="body"><b>Early Decision:</b> Through the junior year (courses

        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">COLLEGE ENTRANCE TESTS </span></p>
        <p class="body">Anxiety about test scores is a significant concern for 
          many college applicants. Often this anxiety is inappropriate for St. 
          Olaf applicants. Of the academic factors considered, the single most 
          important is the achievement record as shown by the candidate's high 
          school transcript. Test results are an important, but clearly secondary, 
          factor. Applicants are advised to take either the ACT or SAT early in 
          the college admissions process, but preferably not later than January 
          of the senior year. High school guidance offices have information on 
          the tests, test dates, testing centers, and registration procedures.

        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">TYPES OF APPLICATION </span></p>
        <p class="body">Three types of application &#151; Early Decision, Early 
          Action, and Regular Decision &#151; are available to students:</p>
        <ol type=A>
          <li class="body"><b>Early Decision Application </b><br>
            Candidates for whom St. Olaf is the first choice may choose to apply 
            under Early Decision. Under Early Decision, qualified candidates who 
            apply by November 15 of the senior year in high school will receive 
            an admission decision mailed by December 15. Early Decision is a commitment 
            application process which means that Early Decision candidates agree 
            that St. Olaf is their first choice and that an offer of admission 
            will be accepted within ten days of notification of admission or within 
            ten days of a financial aid decision and that the candidate will not 
            initiate any new applications at other colleges upon committing to 
            St. Olaf. Early Decision candidates must take the SAT or ACT before, 
            or very early in, the senior year so that the test results will reach 
            the college no later than November 15. St. Olaf expects that all candidates 
            who apply under Early Decision will honor their commitments. Students 
            who do not feel that they can honestly abide by the requests made 
            under Early Decision should apply under our Early Action or Regular 
            Application procedure. Candidates who are unsure as to whether or 
            not Early Decision is appropriate should contact the Admissions Office 
            for more information.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="body"><b>Early Action</b><br>
            Candidates who wish to be considered for the Buntrock Regent Scholarship 
            (the top academic scholarship at St. Olaf) or who are interested in 
            earlier notification of admission should apply under Early Action. 
            Early Action candidates must complete their application by December 
            15 of the senior year. Early Action admission decisions will be mailed 
            on February 1. High School transcripts for Early Action candidates 
            must include grades from first quarter or first trimester of the senior 
            year.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b></li>
          <li class="body"><b>Regular Application </b><br>
            Candidates not applying under Early Decision or Early Action will 
            be considered for admission using our regular application procedure. 
            Regular Application candidates may apply at any point during their 
            senior year, but are encouraged to apply no later than February 1 
            to receive full consideration by the admissions committee. Second 
            trimester or fall semester grades must have been received by the Admissions 
            Office before an application will be reviewed. Admission decisions 
            are sent on a rolling basis beginning March 1. </li>

          </span></p>
        <p class="body">College courses completed in accredited liberal arts colleges

          transfer applicant with a written evaluation of credits accepted by 
          St. Olaf. <br>

          of 17 courses over the equivalent of two years. The grades earned at
