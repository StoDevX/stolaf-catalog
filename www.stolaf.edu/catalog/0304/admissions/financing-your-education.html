The percentage               of Title IV aid to be returned is equal to the number of calendar               days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar               days in the semester.

If there was an unpaid balance,               then all aid sources will be repaid before any funds are returned               to the student. </p>            <p class="change-strikethrough">If a student withdraws during Interim,               federal regulations require that Interim count as a trailer to Fall               Semester. Therefore, all federal and state financial aid received               for Interim will be refunded to the appropriate programs. Institutional               funds will be prorated reflecting the percentage of comprehensive               fee refunded. </p>            <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Institutional Financial Aid               Refunds</span><br>              If a student is receiving only St. Olaf gift funds, the amount of               reduction of the scholarship and grant funds will be pro-rated,               reflecting the percentage of the comprehensive fee refunded. For               example, if 40% of the comprehensive fee is refunded, 40% of scholarships               and grants will be refunded. </p>            <p></p>            <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
