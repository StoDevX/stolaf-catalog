The college operates               on the premise that all students admitted to St. Olaf and in good               academic standing are worthy of financial assistance to attend St.               Olaf if financial need is demonstrated. </p>            <p class="body">The responsibility for financing a St. Olaf education               rests first with the student and his or her family. All new students               who wish to apply for financial aid must complete the College Scholarship               Service (CSS) PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student               Aid (FAFSA). Returning students must complete the FAFSA and the               St. Olaf Application for Financial Aid. Using a standardized formula,               these documents generate, on the basis of the family's financial               situation, the amount of the student's annual educational expenses               the family is expected to meet. That amount is the &quot;expected               family contribution.&quot; <br>              &quot;Demonstrated need&quot; is the difference between the annual               educational expenses at St. Olaf College and the expected family               contribution. Demonstrated need is the basis on which St. Olaf financial               aid is awarded. The college will provide each student with a financial               aid package of scholarship, grants, loans, and/or student work to               meet 100 percent of the demonstrated need. </p>            <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">STUDENT FINANCIAL AID </span></p>            <p class="body">Only full-time students who are degree candidates               at St. Olaf College in their first eight semesters are eligible               for financial assistance from the college. Students enrolled for               a ninth or tenth semester are not eligible for most grant programs               and will have larger loan components in a fifth year of enrollment.             </p>            <p class="body">Financial aid is credited directly to the student's               comprehensive fee account. Financial aid is credited on an equal               basis for the Fall Semester and the Spring Semester. <br>              Students on academic probation may not be eligible to receive scholarship               assistance from St. Olaf during the probationary period. </p>            <p class="body">Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress               (SAP) for all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs.               For more information on SAP policies at St. Olaf, contact the Office               of Financial Aid.</p>            <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">THE ENDOWMENT ADVANTAGE </span></p>            <p class="body">The endowment at St. Olaf (which had a market value               of over $150 million in 2001) consists of funds contributed to St.               Olaf by alumni, parents, faculty, staff, corporations, foundations,               and other friends of the college. The income from those contributions               is applied to &#151; among other programs &#151; grants, scholarships,               and faculty research and travel. </p>            <p class="body">Thanks to the endowment and other annual financial               support, every student attending St. Olaf &#151; whether receiving               financial aid or not &#151; benefits from an indirect form of financial               assistance. Endowment earnings and annual gifts help support the               operating budget of the college and allow St. Olaf to keep tuition               charges at roughly 75 percent of the actual cost. </p>            <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">SCHOLARSHIPS </span></p>            <p class="body">St. Olaf scholarships are available to incoming first-year               students, transfers, and returning students. Eligibility for a St.               Olaf scholarship is based on demonstrated need, other financial               aid, scholastic standing, activity record, test scores, recommendations,               and full-time enrollment. </p>            <p class="body"><b>National Merit Scholarships: </b>Applicants who               have designated St. Olaf College as their first-choice college with               the National Merit Scholarship Corporation are eligible for the               St. Olaf National Merit Scholarship award. St. Olaf sponsors up               to 40 Merit Scholarships each year for incoming students. The minimum               annual award is $5,000. </p>            <p class="body"><b><span class="change-red">Other Merit-Based Scholarships:</span>               </b>St. Olaf also awards scholarships through programs such as the               Buntrock academic scholarship<span class="change-strikethrough">,               Lutheran leadership, and community service programs</span> <span class="change-red">and               the Award for Service and Leadership.</span> For information on               how to apply for the programs detailed on the next page, please               contact the Office of Admission at (507) 646-3025 or (800) 800-3025,               or e-mail to <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/catalog/0304/admissions/mailto@admissions@stolaf.edu">admissions@stolaf.edu</a>.             </p>            <p class="body"><b><span class="change-red">Buntrock Academic Scholarships</span></b>               range from <span class="change-strikethrough">$2,500</span> <span class="change-red">$2,000</span>               to $9,000 per year. The awards are renewable for each of the recipient's               four years at St. Olaf. </p>            <p class="body">Many schools that offer merit and talent scholarships               prescribe strict criteria with respect to a high school G.P.A.,               test scores, class rank, etc. We have found that such prescriptions               often discourage very successful students from competing. As such,               we are inclined to respect the differences among high schools and               not list a set of minimum criteria for scholarship candidates. <br>              Eligibility for Buntrock awards is based primarily on academic performance               in high school, and the selection is highly competitive. Past recipients               have generally presented a high school G.P.A. of 3.6 or higher and               are often in the top five percent of their high school graduating               class. Evidence of participation in extracurricular activities in               addition to academic performance is valued. </p>            <p class="body">Recipients of Buntrock awards may be designated a               Regents Scholar, a Presidential Scholar or a Dean's Scholar.
