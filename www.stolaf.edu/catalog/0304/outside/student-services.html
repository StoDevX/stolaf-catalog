          and efficiency of studying through the Academic Support Center (the 
          ASC). For more information on the services provided by the ASC, look

          Personal and psychological counseling is available through the Student 
          Counseling Center in the form of individual and group counseling sessions. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Services are available to all students on a confidential, 
          no-fee basis. </p>
        <p class="body">The center assists students with a variety of concerns 
          that typically involve issues related to relationships, identity, self-esteem, 
          family, depression, victimization, anxiety/panic attacks, academics, 
          grief and loss, socialization/isolation, food/body image or chemical 
          use/abuse. However, any personal concern is appropriate to bring to 
          the Counseling Center. </p>
        <p class="body">A variety of counseling groups are offered throughout 
          the academic year. These groups focus on topics such as: family issues; 
          food and body image concerns; coping with grief and loss; victimization 
          issues; enhancing relationships; men's issues; women's issues; and personal 
          growth. </p>
        <p class="body">Nutrition counseling is available, on a limited basis, 
          to students who have concerns related to their eating/body image. For 
          these services, students must be referred to the dietician by the Counseling 
          Center staff. </p>
        <p class="body">Medication consultations are also available, on a limited 
          basis, to students who wish to be evaluated for possible medication 
          treatment and/or for ongoing medication management. For these services, 
          students must be referred to the psychiatrist by the Counseling Center 
          staff. </p>
        <p class="body">Personal counseling is also available from the college

          </span><br>
          The Center for Experiential Learning (CEL) was established in 2000 to 
          provide interested St. Olaf students with opportunities for experiential 
          learning that relates to and complements the St. Olaf liberal arts curriculum 
          and enhances their understanding of their individual abilities and how 
          those might apply to future work and service. Programs are implemented 
          through the CEL's Offices for Career Connections, Internships, Servant 
          Leadership and Entrepreneurial Studies. For more information on the 
          CEL, see the Index or visit <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel">http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel/</a>.

          The Multicultural Affairs and Community Outreach office was established 
          to provide services and assist with issues and concerns of African-American, 
          Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino and Native American students. 
          The office also will provide academic advising and financial, personal, 
          career and social counseling when needed. Planning for cultural programming 
          is deliberately integrated with the entire campus in an effort to raise 
          the level of awareness and increase appreciation of cultural, social 
          and ethnic differences. Support and guidance for Harambe, Gospel Club 
          and other student organizations are provided by the office. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">International Student Services </span><br>
          St. Olaf welcomes international students from around the world and Americans 
          educated abroad. Upon their arrival, new international students are 
          met at the airport and brought to the St. Olaf campus. Before the beginning 
          of classes, new international students receive a special orientation 
          to provide assistance with registration, U.S. immigration regulations, 
          housing, banking and U.S. tax concerns. </p>
        <p class="body">International students live in residence halls with American 
          students. Specially trained international student counselors are available 
          to assist students throughout the year. They also plan social activities 
          for international students, their roommates and other St. Olaf students. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Local families enjoy being &quot;friendship families&quot; 
          to international students, and there are several home-stay programs 
          offered for the Christmas holidays. </p>
        <p class="body">The international student adviser is available to students 
          for personal, social, academic, financial and immigration counseling. 
        </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Health Service and Insurance </span><br>
          The St. Olaf College Health Center is under the direction of physicians 
          from the Allina Medical Clinic in Northfield. The on-campus Health Center 
          is located on the lower level of the Administration Building and is 
          staffed by a registered nurse practitioner and a medical technologist. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">All students seeking medical attention are seen initially 
          at the campus facility. Students requiring the services of a physician 
          are then referred by appointment to the Allina Medical Clinic. Medications, 
          supplies, laboratory tests and x-rays are provided at the student's 
          expense. </p>
        <p class="body">Hospital and medical insurance with 12-month coverage 
          is available to students at an additional cost. Information and application 
          forms are sent to parents during the summer. <br>
          A medical history, immunization records and a physical examination are 
          required of all students prior to entering St. Olaf. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Property Insurance </span><br>
          The college does not carry insurance on the personal property of students,
