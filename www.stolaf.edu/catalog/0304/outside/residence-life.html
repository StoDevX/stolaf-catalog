        <p class="body">The residence life program is an integral part of the 
          educational program and academic support services of the college. In 
          the conviction that significant learning takes place outside of the 
          classroom, the college strives to educate students through positive, 
          challenging and supportive residence life experiences. The residence 
          life staff is committed to promoting a healthy living/learning environment 
          in which this education takes place through an emphasis on providing 
          educational, cultural, recreational, social and spiritual opportunities 
          for growth; a commitment to the development of sensitive and responsible 
          individuals; and the enrichment of lifelong friendships. </p>
        <p class="body">One of the major roles of the residence life staff is 
          to help foster the development of community within the residence halls 
          and across campus. The residence life staff seeks to promote a feeling 
          of cooperation and understanding, enhance open communication and provide 
          structured and unstructured opportunities for group interaction. The 
          residence life staff is also responsible for helping to develop an awareness 
          and sensitivity to expectations and standards around which communities 
          are formed and educate through positive confrontational dialogue. </p>
        <p class="body">It is through the combined efforts of the entire residence 
          life staff that the out-of-class experiences of St. Olaf students are 
          brought into partnership with the academic area in the education of 
          the whole person. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Community Standards </span><br>
          As a residential community, St. Olaf has established a set of standards 
          and policies that defines the rules by which we live. St. Olaf students 
          have advisory roles to develop and implement these policies and procedures 
          and hold staff positions where they explain and enforce community standards. 
          St. Olaf College supports open dialogue concerning these policies and 
          standards and how they affect the life of the campus. Students wishing 
          to be involved in this effort are encouraged to become active in their 
          residence hall, student government or student organizations. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">General Policies </span><br>
          The following are general guidelines for community life at St. Olaf. 
          For complete delineation of the policies related to housing and residence 
          life, please refer to <i>The Book</i>, a valuable resource that contains 
          the college's Code of Student Conduct and Official Handbook, available 
          online at <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook">http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook/</a> 
          or contact the Dean of Students Office. </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="body">As a residential college, St. Olaf requires that all 
            full-time students reside in college-owned housing, as far as accommodations 
            will permit. These housing commitments are binding for the entire 
            academic year, unless a student is released from housing by the Residence 
            Life Office. Exceptions are granted to students who are married, are 
            a custodial parent, are living at home in Northfield or are 22 years 
            of age or older by the first day of Fall Semester of the current academic 
            year. For further information concerning off-campus options, please 
            contact the Residence Life Office.</li>
          <li class="body">All first-year students live in designated first-year 
            halls. A long-standing tradition and integral part of the St. Olaf 
            community, small &quot;corridors&quot; of students are assigned to 
            live together and develop living/learning skills in a small-group 
            setting.</li>
          <li class="body">The possession, distribution or consumption of alcoholic 
            beverages is prohibited on the St. Olaf campus, on land owned by the 
            college and in college-owned honor houses. The consumption of alcoholic 
            beverages is prohibited at all college-sponsored functions, no matter 
            where located, that include students.</li>
          <li class="body">St. Olaf prohibits the unlawful possession, distribution 
            or use of illicit drugs and/or controlled substances on any property 
            owned by the college or in any program or activity sponsored by the 
            college in any location.</li>
          <li class="body">For reasons of privacy and safety, the college has 
            established visitation hours for students in the residence halls. 
            Men and women are permitted to visit someone of the opposite sex in 
            private rooms during intervisitation hours: 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday 
            through Thursday; 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday. There are 
            24-hour study and social spaces in every hall.</li>
          <li class="body">Students wishing to keep cars on campus must receive 
            a permit from the Parking Office. Because parking spaces on campus 
            are very limited, a priority system is in place to ensure fair distribution 
            of permits.</li>

        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">Honor and language houses </span><br>
          In addition to its traditional residence halls, St. Olaf has 12 service 
          project houses and five foreign language houses. Located primarily along 
          St. Olaf Avenue just east of the campus, the honor houses are home to 
          140 upperclass students. Each house features a kitchen, living area 
          and laundry facilities. Residents of the service houses participate 
          in service projects associated with volunteer organizations in the Northfield 
          and St. Olaf communities. </p>
        <p class="body">Similar to the service houses, language houses provide 
          a distinctive environment to students who are studying French, German, 
          Norwegian, Spanish and Russian. Inside the houses, residents are encouraged 
          to speak the native language of the country their house represents. 
        </p>
        <p class="body"><br>
          <span class="subhead">Meals </span><br>
          The opportunities of a residential college include the social experience 
          of coming together for meals. The college views meals as an important 
          part of each person's day, not only for nutrition, but also for personal 
          growth through interaction with others. </p>
        <p class="body">All students living on campus in the residence halls, 
          except first-year students, can choose between the Full Board option 
          of 21 meals per week or the 14-Meal Plan which is 14 meals in a week. 
          First-year students are required to have the Full Board Plan. </p>
        <p class="body">There is a special board plan for senior students only. 
          Called the 14-Flex Plan, it offers 14 meals in the cafeteria during 
          the week in addition to an annual amount of $400 credit to be used in 
          the Cage, Kings' Dining Room, or for catering. Students living off campus, 
          in an honor house, student teaching or doing clinicals through the Nursing 
          Department can choose from special plans also. They are the 350 Plan 
          (350 meals in a year) or the 210 Plan (210 meals in a year). They may 
          also choose from the Full Board Plan or 14-Meal Plan. The Senior Flex 
          Plan can also be chosen, provided students have senior status. </p>
        <p class="body">Note that each week begins with Monday breakfast and ends 
          with Sunday dinner. There is no refund or carry over of unused meals 
          or &quot;Flex Dollars.&quot; </p>
