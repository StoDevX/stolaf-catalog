        <p class="goldhead">FINAL EXAMINATIONS</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">A final exam is required for all courses and a special 
            time is reserved in exam week for every course's exam. Teachers may 
            plan an in-class exam for that period or arrange other means of evaluation 
            brought to the final meeting of the class (i.e., a take-home exam, 
            a final paper, etc.). In any case, students must attend the scheduled 
            final exam meeting, whether it is a traditional exam or a special, 
            final meeting of the class. Absence will be reported to the appropriate 
            student dean by the instructor and results in failure of the final 
            exam or the course at the discretion of the instructor.</li>
          <li class="body">Except for courses in performance studies, physical 
            activity and dance activity, an instructor may not use the last day 
            of class for either a written or oral final exam. Take-home exams 
            and papers substituting for final exams must be due at the scheduled 
            the final exam period. </li>
          <li class="body">Students are required to take final exams at the scheduled 
            time unless the instructor, with the written approval of the department 
            chair or program director, has given the student permission to re-schedule 
            to another time during finals week. Student requests for an exam change 
            must be made in writing. The decision rests with the chair or director. 
            Chairs and directors will exclude from consideration rescheduling 
            requests involving rides home, early family vacations, early summer 
            employment, pre-purchased airline tickets and the like. The Student 
            Honor Council welcomes policy that restricts the number of schedule 
            exceptions during finals week.</li>

        <p><span class="body">Graduation requirements for students are reported 
          in this catalog and the Catalog Supplement.</span></p>
        <p class="body"> Graduation requirements are defined only in this catalog 
          and should be reviewed frequently. Students alone have the responsibility 
          of seeing that their academic program includes all requirements for 
          graduation.</p>
        <p class="body">A student must meet the graduation requirements in place 
          at the time he/she first enters St. Olaf as a degree candidate.</p>
        <p class="body">All graduation requirements must be completed before a 
          degree is conferred and a diploma issued. While some requirements may 
          be fulfilled in different ways, graduation requirements themselves cannot 
          be waived. They are not subject to petition or appeal.</p>

            St. Olaf. </li>
          <li class="body">Twenty-one of the 35 credits required for graduation 
            must be outside of the department or program certifying the major.

          <li class="body">A minimum of six full courses in the major must have 
            earned grades above C- (C or higher). </li>
          <li class="body">Two-thirds of all St. Olaf courses must be graded.

            an on-campus course taken during a St. Olaf summer session after graduation.

            registration through St. Olaf either (a) during the last two semesters 
            and Interim preceding the conferring of the degree, or (b) for at 
            least nine of the last 12 full courses. For instance, seniors may 
            spend one of their last terms at another institution only if a maximum 
            of three courses are applied to the St. Olaf degree. A senior may 
            spend the final semester on a St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus program.</span>

          Degree&quot; entry. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">General Education requirements constitute the &quot;core&quot; 
          degree requirements of the curriculum. Consult this catalog for a full 
          description of General Education requirements.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Courses are described in this catalog and in the 
          Catalog Supplement; courses fulfilling a given General Education requirement 
          are indicated in this catalog, the Catalog Supplement and the Class 
          and Lab Schedule. Note that St. Olaf's General Education curriculum 
          does not work by a distribution system (so many courses in certain disciplines); 
          rather, it identifies an area of learning for General Education and 
          sets out a series of guidelines which inform the construction of courses. 
          Departments and programs submit their course proposals to a General 
          Education committee which judges whether a course fulfills a requirement. 
          Because the college's expectations for General Education are distinctive 
          and characteristic of this college alone, students must be particularly 
          careful as they plan off-campus and transfer work. The Registrar's Office 
          can help determine how transfer work can apply to St. Olaf's General 
          Education requirements; advisers of off-campus programs determine whether 
          a non-St. Olaf course applies to the General Education requirements.</span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The foreign language requirement is described only 
          in this catalog under &quot;Graduation Requirements.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="body">All St. Olaf students must satisfy the foreign language 
          requirement. This may be done either by completing the fourth semester 
          of French, German, or Spanish, or the third semester of Chinese, Japanese, 
          Russian, Norwegian, Greek, or Latin, or by demonstrating equivalent 
          proficiency. For students with learning disabilities specific to foreign 
          language, there is an alternate way to satisfy the foreign language 
          requirement, as approved by the St. Olaf faculty on October 16, 1974:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="body">&quot;After completion of the work in a foreign language 
            course at St. Olaf College, the student who receives a D or F or no 
            credit may petition to satisfy all (in the case of an F or no credit 
            in a Language 111 course) or any remaining portion of the requirement 
            by taking Foreign Culture and Civilization or Literature in English 
            Translation.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="body">Alternatives to this requirement are rarely considered. 
          In most cases, they can be initiated by the student only upon completion 
          of a course as explained above. Criteria for granting permission for 
          an alternative include, but are not limited to, strict adherence to 
          language course requirements and class attendance, plus evidence of 
          having worked with a tutor assigned by the Academic Support Center. 
          In a limited number of cases involving students with specific learning 
          disabilities as detailed in Public Law 94-142 (the Education for All 
          Handicapped Children Act of 1975), Section 5(b)(4), a faculty member 
          or a student may initiate the procedure to request an alternative to 
          the foreign language requirement before the student completes the course, 
          as detailed in guidelines approved by the faculty on May 10, 1988. A 
          student experiencing foreign language difficulty should first consult 
          the instructor of the foreign language course and also his/her academic 
          adviser; these faculty may also refer the student to the Academic Support 
          Center.</p>
        <p class="body">Students planning to fulfill the foreign language requirement 
          with transfer courses from other institutions should be aware of St. 
          Olaf's requirement of intermediate proficiency in one foreign language.</p>
        <p class="body">Proficiency reports from persons not known to St. Olaf 
          must be based on documented exposure or training by the student in a 
          foreign language equivalent in length to three or four college semesters, 
          or demonstration of a sufficient length of time in a non-English speaking 
          culture to give credence to a proficiency report. As a rule, proficiency 
          reports from persons outside of St. Olaf are not acted upon until the 
          student arranges for a final proficiency exam by persons and methods 
          agreed to by members of the foreign language faculty, the registrar 
          and, if deemed necessary, the dean of the college. Such exams may involve 
          an expense charged to the student.</p>
        <p class="body">Questions concerning the transfer of foreign language 
          courses to St. Olaf should be directed in advance to the registrar.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COURSES (PHA)</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Two one-quarter physical activity courses in different 
          physical subjects or one .50 credit course in Physical Education are 
          required for graduation. It is strongly recommended that both of these 
          courses be completed before the senior year. The following regulations 
          are often misunderstood: </span></p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">Students not appearing on the first class day of a 
            physical activity course are normally dropped from the course by the 
            instructor. In this event, the student must still drop the course 
            at the Registrar's Office by the posted drop deadline. The instructor 
            does not assume this responsibility. </li>
          <li class="body">Only one physical activity course credit may be earned 
            by students as a result of participation in an approved intercollegiate 
            sport. This credit must be entered as Physical Education 171-194 at 
            the registration preceding the sport/participation term. Credit cannot 
            be claimed after the term in which participation took place. An intercollegiate 
            physical education (.25) credit can only be used within the two quarter-credit 
            physical education graduation requirement. An intercollegiate physical 
            education (.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose 
            of earning a credit toward the 35 full-credit course requirement for 
            graduation. It can only be used once as one-half of the two-course 
            PHA requirement. <br>
          </li>
          <li class="body">Dance 101 and 104 are .50 credit courses, but each 
            earns only one PHA credit and cannot be counted for both (.25) PHA 
            requirements. </li>
          <li class="body">Students may register initially for only one physical 
            activity. On a space-available basis a second physical activity may 
            be added with a signed drop/add slip within the drop/add dates published 
            in this catalog. </li>
          <li class="body">After the Physical Activity (PHA) requirement has been 
            completed, students may repeat Physical Activities (all those coded 
            department 59) under the following conditions: 
            <ul>
              <li>The PHA requirement is completed with two different PE activities.</li>
              <li>Students repeating a PE must wait until the first day of classes 
                to register the repeated activity to allow all current students 
                to register for the PHA requirement.</li>
              <li>Students may only register on a &quot;space available&quot; 
                (open courses) basis.</li>
              <li>PE activities may only be repeated 4 times. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="goldhead">MAJORS </span></p>
        <p><span class="body"><i>Minimum of eight courses in the major</i></span></p>
        <p class="body">One completed major is required for graduation. Students 
          must declare a major no later than the time of registration for interim 
          and semester II of their junior year by filling out a form available 
          at the registrar's office. Students are allowed to change this declaration 
          or add a second major at a later date. Only this catalog defines the 
          specific requirements for each departmental or interdisciplinary major. 
          Depending on the department or interdisciplinary program, the number 
          of courses required for a major ranges from eight to 12 courses, with 
          some departments recommending course work in other departments.</p>
        <p class="body">Departments and interdisciplinary programs may require 
          comprehensive examinations or special research projects. <br>
          While the maximum course credits in any one department allowed toward 
          the 35.00 course graduation requirement may vary, 21 credits must be 
          completed outside of the department or program certifying the major. 
          If a student has a double major, courses taken in the second major count 
          toward the 21 credits outside of the first major. In order for a student 
          to be certified in a second or third major, 21 credits also must be 
          taken outside of those majors as well.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Other regulations are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body"> A minimum of six full-credit courses above C- (C or 
            higher) must be completed in the major field. </li>
          <li class="body">Only one full-course equivalent taken S/U may count 
            toward the minimum requirements for a major. </li>
          <li class="body">At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken 
            through St. Olaf. Students should consult the appropriate department 
            chair or program director about counting toward a major courses taken 
            at other colleges. The chairs should sign the student's transfer of 
            credit form (available from the Registrar's Office) if work from other 
            institutions is accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through 
            St. Olaf off-campus programs should be approved by the chairs/directors 
            and the off-campus program adviser in advance if credit toward a major 
            is desired.</li>
          <li class="body">Certification of the completed major is done by the 
            department chairs and interdisciplinary directors. </li>
          <li class="body">A graduated senior may add a second major to the St. 
            Olaf record if not more than two courses from another institution 
            are subsequently applied. </li>
          <li class="body">Graduation requirements for majors within the Bachelor 
            of Music degree may vary widely. Students should consult this catalog 
            and the Music Department chair. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="goldhead">DOUBLE MAJORS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Attaining two or three majors within the confines 
          of 35 courses often is difficult. The student should consult frequently 
          with his/her adviser and the chairs or directors of the majoring departments 
          and programs. Three regulations are important: </span></p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">Twenty-one credits outside of the department certifying 
            the major are required for graduation. Courses applied to a second 
            major, as well as Education Department courses attending a major, 
            count toward the 21 &quot;outside&quot; credits. Twenty-one credits 
            outside of each of the second or third majors are required in order 
            to certify those majors as complete and recorded on the student's 
            transcript. </li>
          <li class="body">A graduate may add a second major to the St. Olaf record 
            if no more than two courses from another institution are subsequently 
            applied to the second major. </li>
          <li class="body">Certification of a completed major is the responsibility/prerogative 
            of the department chairs or program directors, not the registrar. 
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="goldhead">SECOND DEGREES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Should a student desire to earn both the Bachelor 
          of Arts degree and the Bachelor of Music degree at St. Olaf, he/she 
          must complete a minimum of 43 courses, with the last 17 earned through 
          St. Olaf. In addition, both the junior and the senior year must be spent 
          in residence or a fifth year of residence must be added to the senior 
          year. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">MUSIC</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Music major 
          and the degree requirements for the Bachelor of Music are defined only 
          in this catalog. Students should also consult the Music Handbook. Bachelor 
          of Arts Music and Music Education majors should be careful to complete 
          21 credits outside of the major. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">MUSICAL ORGANIZATIONS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Student participation in campus musical organizations 
          (choirs, orchestras, bands, ensembles, etc.) is not awarded course credit. 
          </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">PERFORMANCE STUDIES COURSES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Performance studies courses (music lessons) are 
          always Level I courses for Bachelor of Arts students.<br>
          Performance studies courses (lessons) are Upper Level courses for Bachelor 
          of Music students only in their principal performing medium and only 
          during the junior and senior years.</span></p>
        <p class="body">Generally, performance studies courses are fractional 
          (.25) courses, not full credit courses. Registration for performance 
          studies courses must be approved by the Music Department. Registration 
          instructions are published in the Class and Lab Schedule. Lessons may 
          be added to or dropped from a student's registration only with a music 
          lesson drop/add slip available from the Music Office. This drop/add 
          slip must be processed by the Music Department secretary before it will 
          be accepted in the Registrar's Office.</p>
        <p class="body">Registration for performance studies lessons may result 
          in an additional fee; see the Music Office for details. If a student 
          drops a performance studies course (lessons) after the first day of 
          class, no refund of music lesson fees is made.</p>
