          in a vault in the Registrar's Office.<br>
          </span></p>

        </p>

          Corrections of errors on the academic record must be reported to the 
          registrar within one year.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Questions concerning transcripts and academic records 
          should be directed to the Registrar's Office.</p>
        <p class="body">Procedures affecting St. Olaf's academic records are in 
          accordance with the U.S. Family Privacy Law of 1974. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">FAMILY PRIVACY LAW: ACADEMIC RECORDS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">St. Olaf protects student academic records in accordance 
          with the U.S. Family Privacy Law of 1974. Permanent records may be released 
          only upon the written consent of the student. While the college does 
          not send grade reports to parents or guardians, such information can 
          be made available to eligible individuals upon special request. The 
          provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 
          prohibit the college from releasing grades or other information about 
          academic standing to parents unless the student has released such information 
          in writing, or unless the student is a dependent as defined by FERPA. 
          (Essentially, a student is considered a dependent if he or she is legitimately 
          claimed as such on the parent's most recent IRS income tax form, or 
          if the parent(s) is paying a portion of the student's college expenses.) 
          Forms are available in the Office of the Dean of Students for parents 
          who request this information. Further information concerning St. Olaf 
          College procedures in compliance with FERPA is available in <i>The Book</i>, 
          available online at <a href="/stulife/thebook">http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook</a>, 
          and from the Office of the Dean of Students. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">CATALOG</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The St. Olaf College Academic Catalog or the Catalog 
          Supplement is published once each year. Students must meet the graduation 
          requirements outlined in this catalog in the year they first enter St. 
          Olaf as degree candidates. Academic regulations and procedures as they 
          apply to students may change during their time at St. Olaf, but graduation 
          requirements remain those in effect at the time of entry. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">CERTIFICATIONS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The Registrar's Office certifies many forms including 
          insurance forms and student loan papers. Certifications requiring the 
          release of a grade point average or rank in class must be accompanied 
          by a written request from the student. Facts of public record are confirmed 
          without written request. These include dates of attendance, graduation 
          and major. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">DEGREE AUDITS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">A degree audit is a computerized review of a student's 
          course transcript matched against the college's requirements for a degree. 
          Except for progress in the major, the senior residency requirement, 
          six courses with grades of C or higher in the major and the 21-outside-course 
          requirement, it tells the student where he/she stands relative to graduation 
          at a given moment. <br>
          </span></p>
        <p class="body">Students should report an error found on a degree audit 
          to the registrar immediately. The student alone is responsible for understanding 
          and meeting degree requirements.<br>
          Students have immediate access to their degree audits on the Web and 
          may print a copy of it at any time. Along with the deans and other academic 
          officers, advisers and students may request printed audits on a need-to-know 
          basis.</p>
        <p class="body">Copies of the degree audit are available to students free 
          of charge on a next-day basis at the registrar's window. Students must 
          pick them up in person by presenting a picture identification and signing 
          a receipt.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Like transcripts, degree audits are private documents. 
          The Registrar's Office cannot provide copies to third parties inside 
          or outside of the college, including to other students acting as proxies. 
          As is the case with all academic records, St. Olaf's procedures regarding 
          student degree audits are administered in compliance with the U.S. Family 
          Privacy Law of 1974. </p>

        <p class="body">Students have the right to appeal petitions denied or 
          fees assigned by the registrar to the committee by re-submitting the 
          petition to the registrar. If the committee has completed business for 
          the semester or year, decisions may be delayed over a vacation break

        <p><span class="goldhead">FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Permission to register, as well as the release of 
          an official transcript or a diploma, will be denied to students who 
          have outstanding financial obligations to the college. Questions should 
          be directed to the Business Office. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">ACADEMIC HANDLING FEES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The Registrar's Office assigns a handling fee for 
          special services such as late registrations, late course adds or drops 
          and other changes in registration or appeals done by petition. Petition 
          forms are available from the registrar. Students may appeal the fee 
          to the curriculum and educational policies committee by resubmitting 
          the petition to the registrar. Decisions of the committee are final. 
          If the student submits an appeal after the committee has finished business 
          for the semester or year, a decision may be delayed until after a vacation 
          or summer break. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">PETITIONS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Students may petition for waivers to academic regulations, 
          fees and college deadlines at any time during the regular academic year. 
          Petition forms are available from, and returnable to, the Registrar's 
          Office. A student will be notified through his/her mailbox when a petition 
          has been acted on and is ready for pick-up at the registrar's window.</span></p>
        <p class="body"> In cases where a petition is denied, or a fee charged 
          by the registrar, the student may appeal to the curriculum and educational 
          policies committee by resubmitting the original petition to the registrar. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Petition forms must be completed in full with appropriate 
          faculty signatures where applicable. The petition form must be accompanied 
          by a written explanation setting forth the circumstances of the student's 
          case under petition/appeal. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">REFUND POLICY (WITHDRAWALS)</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Tuition and fee refunds for anyone leaving within 
          five weeks after the beginning date of any semester will be determined 
          according to the following scale: <br>
          </span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="body">One week or less &#151; 90% refund<br>
            Two weeks or less &#151; 80% refund<br>
            Three weeks or less &#151; 60% refund<br>
            Four weeks or less &#151; 40% refund<br>
            Five weeks or less &#151; 20% refund<br>
            Over five weeks &#151; no refund </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="body">Students who enroll for the year but who elect to omit 
          an Interim are not entitled to a refund of Interim tuition and room. 
          Students not participating in an Interim program are eligible for an 
          Interim board refund through application at the Business Office. If 
          a student drops a performance studies course (lesson) after the first 
          day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">TRANSCRIPTS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The transcript is a complete and unabridged course 
          record. In addition to courses and grades, the transcript reports the 
          grade point average. The student's rank in class along with major, honors 
          or other distinctions are recorded on the transcript once they are fixed 
          immediately prior to commencement.</span></p>
        <p class="body">Transcripts of the academic record are available in three 
          formats: official transcripts, unofficial transcripts and transcript/degree 
          audits. Unofficial transcripts and transcript/degree audits are available 
          to current students free of charge on a next-day basis at the Registrar's 
          Office. They are issued on plain paper and do not bear the raised seal 
          or the imprimatur of the college. They must be received in person. Picture 
          identification is required.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Upon written request, official transcripts may be received 
          in person, by mail or sent to third parties. Official transcripts are 
          printed on college-designed paper with appropriate signatures for $3.00 
          per copy. Only official transcripts can be mailed. Regardless of a student's 
          location &#151; on or off campus &#151; telephone requests for transcripts 
          cannot be accepted under any condition. Under special conditions, the 
          Registrar's Office will accept a faxed request for an official transcript: 
          contact the office [(507) 646-3015, fax (507) 646-3210, e-mail: <a href="mailto:registrar@stolaf.edu">registrar@stolaf.edu</a>)] 
          to be informed on the steps.<br>
          A copy of the transcript may be released only upon the written consent 
          of the individual student, or in conjunction with &quot;Academic Records 
          and Transcripts&quot; defined in <i>The Book</i>, <a href="/stulife/thebook">http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/thebook</a>. 
          For example, faculty advisers receive issues of the transcript/degree 
          audit each year but, along with deans and other academic officers, may 
          request them at other times. Parents may not receive student transcripts 
          independent of the student's written request unless approved in advance 
          by the dean of students.</p>
        <p class="body">Current students can have access to their transcripts 
          through St. Olaf's pages on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p class="body">St. Olaf's transcript/records policy is administered in
