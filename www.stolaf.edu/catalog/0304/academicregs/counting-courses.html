        <p><span class="goldhead">COURSE</span><br>
          <span class="body">For numerical purposes the term &quot;course&quot; 
          means a full (1.00) course credit, as distinguished from fractional 
          course credits. </span> </p>
        <p class="body">St. Olaf courses are not denominated in semester or quarter 
          credits. Each St. Olaf course is equivalent to 4.00 semester credits 
          or 5.50 quarter credits.</p>
        <p class="body">Course descriptions are printed in this catalog or in 
          the Catalog Supplement. Course offerings during a given semester are 
          listed in the Class and Lab Schedules, which are published three times 
          a year. </p>
        <p class="body">Thirty-five full courses are required for the Baccalaureate 
          degree. Unless reduced as the result of transfer credits, 24 of the 
          35 courses must be taken on a graded basis. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">HALF-SEMESTER COURSES</span><br>
          <span class="body">Half-semester courses have drop/add and S/U deadlines 
          that are different from full-semester courses. Consult the academic 
          calendar in this catalog, the Class and Lab Schedule, and the registrar's 
          web site. If a student is taking a full load of 4.50 courses with the 
          .50 being a first-half semester course, he/she cannot register for a 
          second-half semester course unless he/she meets the criteria for an 
          overload stated under &quot;Course Loads&quot; in this catalog. </span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Note that &quot;1&quot; designates a first-half 
          semester course and &quot;2&quot; a second-half course in the Class 
          and Lab Schedule. If there is a &quot;1&quot; next to the Lab/Disc column, 
          the course is offered during the first half of the semester. If there 
          is a &quot;2&quot; next to the Lab/Disc column, the course is offered 
          in the second half of the semester. </span></p>

          <span class="body">Often credit earned from specific courses varies 
          with different Baccalaureate degrees, core requirements and majors. 
          Rely on this catalog and the Class and Lab Schedules for information 
          about which courses fulfill General Education requirements.</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">Performance studies courses are always Level I when 
            counted toward the Bachelor of Arts degree. Credit for performance 
            studies courses is counted as Upper Level in the principal performing 
            medium for Bachelor of Music degree students only during the junior 
            and senior years. </li>
          <li class="body">Dance activity courses count toward the physical activity 
            requirement (PHA). </li>
          <li class="body">If a student repeats a course, that course may earn 
            only one credit after it has been completed with a passing grade. 
            A course may be repeated only once, only at St. Olaf and only when 
            the grade is C- or below, U or N. A course cannot be repeated after 
            satisfactory completion of any course in the same department for which 
            the course is considered a pre-requisite, unless specifically required 
            to graduate. A course may be repeated S/U only if the course was originally 
            taken S/U and a U was received. If a course receives an S credit, 
            it may not be repeated regardless of the actual reported grade. A 
            course may earn only one credit once completed with a passing grade. 
            Each course attempt remains part of the permanent record, but only 
            the second grade is computed into the grade point average. </li>
          <li class="body">After students have graduated with a degree, the college 
            will not accept additional courses transferred from other colleges 
            except two courses to complete an additional major.</li>
          <li class="body">A student may not take an independent study for a course 
            regularly offered in a department of the college. Independent study 
            or research may count toward a major, but may not fulfill a General 
            Education requirement (except as a course with writing [WRI]). </li>
          <li class="body">Twenty-four of the 35 full courses required for graduation 
            must be taken on a graded basis unless that number has been reduced 
            by transfer or off-campus course work.</li>
          <li class="body">A student must complete at least six courses with grades 
            of C or higher in a major in order to complete the major requirement. 
            A grade of C- or S does not count in fulfilling this requirement.

          numbers in this catalog and in the Class and Lab Schedules as Level 
          I, II and III. </span></p>
        <p class="body">Level I Courses, numbered 100 through 199, are for the 
          most part introductory to a field or discipline. They exert a demand 
          for only such depth of study, student responsibility and independence 
          commensurate with initial work at the college level.</p>
        <p class="body">Level II Courses, numbered 200 through 299, require student 
          independence in the acquisition of material and mastery of techniques 
          and methods above that demanded in Level I courses.</p>
        <p class="body">Level III Courses, numbered 300 through 399, are usually 
          confined to the major and demand control of methods as well as command 
          of basic factual and theoretical knowledge appropriate to the discipline. 
          A student should have at least two Level III courses in the major.</p>

          A course with a lower number cannot, as the result of extra work, become 
          another course of a higher number because of scheduling conflicts or 
          closed course status. For example, Art 119 (.50) cannot earn credit

          <span class="body">4.5 courses is the typical, maximum course load allowed 
          from all sources during a semester and only one course may be taken 
          during Interim. Note that a student cannot add a course so as to create 
          a course overload; a course must be dropped first if an added course 
          would put the student's course load over the allowed 4.5 maximum. <br>
          With the permission of the registrar, a student may exceed 4.5 courses 
          during a semester if:</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body">The student is a senior, for whom the maximum load 
            is 5.00 full courses during one semester of the senior year. The senior 
            year is defined as the two semesters prior to graduation either as 
            a participator or as a diploma graduate. </li>
          <li class="body">The student has a 3.60 grade point average over the 
            nine most recent, full St. Olaf courses and thereby can take up to 
            the maximum load of 5.00 full courses. <br>
            First-year students are not eligible for course overloads. <br>
            <br>
            To be considered full-time, a student must be registered for at least 
            3.00 course credits. Students receiving veterans benefits need 3.00 
            course credits to be considered full-time. Four full-credit semester 
            courses are required to maintain certain forms of State of Minnesota 
            financial aid. Note that all students will receive an extra tuition 
            charge for course overloads beyond 4.5 credits. See &quot;Additional

          should contact the Registrar's Office. <br>
          Under no condition can grades be reported by telephone or to third parties,

        <p><span class="goldhead">GRADE CHANGES</span><br>
          <span class="body">A student has one year to notify the Registrar's 
          Office of a grade error on the transcript. A grade error is a recording 
          mistake made by the Registrar's Office. </span></p>
        <p class="body">Grade changes, on the other hand, are initiated by the 
          instructor issuing the original grade. The instructor submits a grade 
          change request to the registrar/assistant vice president for academic

          than one of the minimum full courses required for a departmental or 
          interdisciplinary major may be taken on an S/U basis. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">GRADED AND UNGRADED COURSES</span><br>
          <span class="body">A minimum of 24 full (1.00) graded courses out of 
          35 full equivalent courses is required for graduation. A reduction scale 
          printed below is used if not all course work is taken at St. Olaf, or 
          if credit is earned through special programs such as Advanced Placement. 
          As a rule, two-thirds of the courses taken at St. Olaf must be graded. 
          The graded course requirement is reduced by scale in the following instances:</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li> <span class="body">Credits transferred into St. Olaf from another 
            institution. However, credits taken on an off-campus program through 
            another institution if less than two semesters in length will not 
            reduce the number of graded course credits required for graduation. 
            This rule applies to students who matriculate at St. Olaf before going 
            on a non-St. Olaf off-campus program.</span></li>

            that are two semesters in length. <br>
            <br>
            A semester-length St. Olaf off-campus program or combinations of several 
            semester-length off-campus programs will not reduce the number of 
            graded credits required. However, a course taught by a St. Olaf instructor 
            on an off-campus program is considered a graded course and counts 
            toward the 24 required if taken for a letter grade.<br>
            <br>
            A full-year off-campus program gives a student partial graded course 
            credit toward the 24-graded-course requirement even though the letter 
            grades from a full-year program are not computed in the grade point 
            average unless taught by a St. Olaf instructor. Under these conditions, 
            the 24-graded-course requirement is reduced as follows:</span><br>

            Six courses earned &#151; three graded courses reduced<br>
            <br>
            Interim exchange courses do not reduce the number of graded courses
