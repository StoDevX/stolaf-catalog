            <p><span class="goldhead">AUDITING COURSES/SUCCESSFUL AUDITS</span></p>
            <p><span class="body">All persons attending, auditing or participating 
              in a program of instruction must officially register with the college. 
              Permission of the instructor is required to audit a course. An auditor 
              is a visitor in a class and participates in its activities only 
              at the invitation of the instructor. Students are discouraged from 
              auditing courses that involve performance, lab work or extensive 
              use of equipment such as studios, gymnasia and computers. Auditors 
              take exams or hand in written work only at the direction of the 
              instructor. A person who has audited a course may not subsequently 
              earn credit for it by special examination. Students auditing courses 
              where tests and evaluations are used to establish an early grade 
              pattern may not register those courses for credit after the add 
              deadline has passed. Auditing of summer school courses is not permitted. 
              </span></p>
            <p class="body"><br>
              Successful Audits: A person attempting a successful audit must have 
              the permission of the instructor at the time of entering the course 
              and should negotiate the conditions necessary for completion of 
              a successful audit with the instructor at that time. A successful 
              audit form, available from the Registrar's Office, is to be completed 
              by the student and the instructor together and returned by the student 
              to the Registrar's Office no later than the last day to drop a class 
              for the semester in which the course is being offered. A properly 
              documented successful audit will be entered on the auditor's transcript. 
              Successful audits are not awarded course or grade credit nor do 
              audits fulfill graduation requirements in whole or in part. Auditors 
              other than registered full-time St. Olaf and Carleton students or 
              staff will be required to pay 20% of the current tuition charge 
              per course. </p>
            <p><span class="goldhead">CARLETON INTER-REGISTRATION</span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Full-time, degree-seeking St. Olaf and Carleton 
              College students may enroll in courses on either campus. Inter-registration 
              is limited to one course per term. A course taken at Carleton must 
              receive prior approval of the Carleton instructor and registrar 
              and be worth at least six variable Carleton credits. A Carleton 
              course must be properly registered in order for credit to be awarded 
              (see procedure below). As a general rule Carleton will not inter-register 
              St. Olaf students for Carleton courses which are routinely taught 
              at St. Olaf. Carleton courses are computed in the St. Olaf grade 
              point average.</span></p>
            <p class="body">Registration for a Carleton Winter Term course is 
              considered a full St. Olaf load. A St. Olaf student may not simultaneously 
              register for a St. Olaf Interim. A Carleton Winter Term course counts 
              as one St. Olaf Interim (January Term).</p>
            <p class="body">Physical Activity courses must be inter-registered. 
              A PHA course taken at Carleton will count toward the General Education 
              requirement (PHA) at St. Olaf, but no credit will be given toward 
              the total number of courses required for graduation. A student wishing 
              to apply a Carleton course to his/her major should consult with 
              the appropriate department chair or program director before completing 
              the inter-registration procedure. Consult the Registrar's Office 
              for the procedure to secure General Education credit approval before 
              completing the inter-registration process.</p>
            <p class="body">To enroll in a Carleton College course:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">Obtain an application from the St. Olaf registrar.</li>
              <li class="body">Obtain the signature of the Carleton instructor 
                and the Carleton registrar.</li>
              <li class="body">Complete an application each term that you take 
                a Carleton course. Example: You must register for two Carleton 
                terms if you wish to take the Hebrew 101-102 sequence.</li>
              <li class="body">Return the completed application to the St. Olaf 
                registrar's window for approval. The application will then be 
                sent to Carleton for approval and a copy returned to the student. 
              </li>
              <li class="body">Drop a Carleton course by obtaining a change of 
                registration form from the St. Olaf registrar's window. Have it 
                signed by the Carleton instructor; return it to the St. Olaf registrar 
                by the posted Carleton drop deadline. <br>
                <br>
                Note that St. Olaf students cannot register for an independent 
                study or independent research with a Carleton faculty member.

              College. An academic internship is a planned, supervised, experiential 
              learning project integrating study and practical work. As a credit-bearing 
              experience it allows students to acquire and apply knowledge through 
              direct experience in a field related to their academic program. 
              The academic internship is intended to integrate on-site learning 
              with the knowledge base of a related discipline. Academic integrity 
              is assured through established department/program criteria, faculty 
              supervision, an Academic Internship Learning Plan and guidance from 
              the Office for Internships. </span></p>

              <li class="change-red">Each academic internship must have a St.

                with the same number in that department, provided it has a different 
                focus.</li>
              <li class="change-red">A student may be paid for work done during 
                the academic internship.</li>

                on the student's official transcript, but do not count in the 
                St. Olaf grade point average or toward the 24-graded-course requirement. 
                There is an exception to each: <br>

                <ol type=a>
                  <li class="body">A course taught by a St. Olaf professor within 
                    a program is computed into the St. Olaf grade point average 
                    and toward the 24-graded-course requirement.</li>
                  <li class="body">A full-year program (not a semester-length 
                    program) gives a student partial graded course credit toward 
                    the 24-graded-course requirement even though the letter grades 
                    from a full-year program are not computed in the grade point 
                    average unless taught by a St. Olaf instructor.<br>
                    <br>
                    Under these conditions, the 24-graded-course requirement is 
                    reduced as follows: <br>
                    <br>
                    Nine courses earned &#151; four graded courses reduced<br>

                    Seven courses earned &#151; three graded courses reduced<br>
                    Six courses earned &#151; three graded courses reduced<br>
                    <br>
                    Graded course reduction is not permitted for less than six 
                    off-campus, full-course credits in a single program experience. 
                    It follows that semester-length or a combination of different 
                    semester-length programs do not reduce the 24-graded-course 
                    requirement. </li>

            <p><span class="body">From September 1969 through May 2000, the Paracollege 
              offered any student in good academic standing an alternative, or 
              &quot;parallel,&quot; means of earning the St. Olaf B.A. degree. 
              With close supervision from faculty advisers, students put together 
              educational programs that served their own academic objectives. 
              Paracollege students fulfilled graduation requirements that were 
              different from, though comparable to, the St. Olaf general education 
              requirements. They used a variety of options to achieve their educational 
              goals, including individual or group tutorials with a faculty member, 
              seminars in the Paracollege, courses in the general college and 
              portfolios. Each Paracollege student completed their work with a 
              senior concentration, an individually constructed and usually interdisciplinary 
              area of study. Students' work in the Paracollege was evaluated by 
              P/N or letter grade depending on the type of course, but always 
              also by a narrative evaluation from the faculty instructor. These 
              narrative evaluations are part of each Paracollege graduate's official 
              academic record.</span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Current students who would like the opportunity 
              to construct a plan of study for themselves should consult with 
              the Center for Integrative Studies, which opened in September 1999, 
              about the option of designing and proposing an individual major, 
              the successor to the Paracollege senior concentration. For more 
              information about individual majors or other programs of the Center 
              for Integrative Studies, consult the Index. </span> </p>
            <p><span class="goldhead">SPECIAL STUDENTS</span></p>
            <p><span class="body">Special students are defined as short-term (one 
              year or less) students who do not plan to graduate from St. Olaf. 
              High school area senior honor students are one category of special 
              students; continuing education students are also considered special 
              students. Anyone not in the categories mentioned above who wishes 
              to register as a special student must consult the Office of Admissions 
              and submit transcripts from any high school or college previously 
              attended. In most instances the registrar requires written authorization 
              for admission from the Office of Admissions.<br>
              Part-time students are those who intend to graduate from St. Olaf 
              and who register for fewer than three course credits. Such students 
              must follow the regular admissions procedure. </span></p>
            <p class="body">Both special and part-time students always register 
              on the first day of classes at the registrar's window. </p>
            <p><span class="goldhead">SUMMER SCHOOL AT ST. OLAF</span></p>
            <p><span class="body">The St. Olaf College summer school consists 
              of two five-and-one-half-week terms, during each of which a student 
              may take a maximum of 2.50 courses. Thus, one may take as many as 
              5.00 courses during the summer session. Course descriptions, costs 
              and other details are available in the Summer School Catalog. Questions 
              about summer school programs, credits and registration should be 
              directed to the Registrar's Office.</span></p>
            <p class="body">Summer school tuition must be paid before a student 
              will be permitted to register for summer courses.</p>
            <p><span class="body">Seniors anticipating completion of degree requirements 
              through St. Olaf summer school should be aware of limited course 
              offerings in a typical summer session.</span> </p>
