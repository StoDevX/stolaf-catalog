        <p class="programname">Leaving St. Olaf</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">LEAVE OF ABSENCE </span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Upon withdrawing from St. Olaf, a student in good 
          academic standing may apply to the Office of the Dean of Students for 
          a leave of absence. An approved leave provides the student with the 
          right to return to St. Olaf without re-applying to the Office of Admissions. 
          For students who are granted a leave of absence for medical reasons, 
          the Office of the Dean of Students may require documentation from a 
          health-care provider indicating the student is prepared to return to 
          St. Olaf.<br>
          </span></p>
        <p class="body">The leave of absence provides the student with the opportunity 
          to register for future St. Olaf courses at the normal time of registration 
          in a given semester either in person or through a proxy. In addition, 
          a student planning to return after a leave of absence may participate 
          in room draw at its regular time either through a proxy or in person.</p>
        <p class="body">The leave of absence agreement requires that returning 
          students make the minimum tuition deposit at least four weeks prior 
          to registration or room draw and to notify the Registrar's Office (in 
          cases of registration) and the Dean of Students Office (in the case 
          of room draw) of their intention to return to St. Olaf.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Students who are on a leave of absence of less than 180 
          days duration will continue to be considered enrolled full-time, in 
          good standing, for the purposes of Title IV student loan deferment (i.e., 
          Federal Stafford Loan and Federal Perkins Loan.) This allows the borrower 
          to avoid utilizing the grace period attached to those loans. This provision 
          is limited to one leave of absence in a twelve-month period. However, 
          if at the end of the leave of absence, the student fails to return to 
          St. Olaf, the student's withdrawal date will be back-dated to the last 
          date of attendance. This may cause the borrower to be required to enter 
          immediate repayment on the affected Title IV loans. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">The college reserves the right to deny re-admission where 
          intervening circumstances warrant such denial. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">CANDIDACY FOR THE DEGREE</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">During Fall Semester, members of the senior class 
          apply for candidacy for the degree to which their courses apply. Application 
          is made through the Registrar's Office. Only such members of the senior 
          class as have been accepted as candidates for a degree will participate 
          in Commencement events. Seniors not filing this application risk being 
          overlooked for a diploma and inclusion in the Commencement program. 
          Seniors who will complete all requirements and graduate after Fall Semester 
          or Interim will be contacted individually and asked to apply for candidacy 
          in late October.</span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">COMMENCEMENT</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Commencement exercises are held each May for graduating 
          seniors who are members of that class and who have successfully completed 
          35 credits and all other requirements for the degree.<br>
          </span></p>
        <p class="body">Seniors who have successfully completed 33 of the 35 required 
          credits with a minimum 2.00 grade point average may &quot;participate&quot; 
          in Commencement exercises. A participator's name will appear with appropriate 
          honors designation in the Commencement program, but he/she will not 
          receive a diploma until the completion of all requirements. The grade 
          point average for participators may change if their remaining course 
          work is completed at St. Olaf. Honors may also change, but rank in class 
          remains unchanged. The grade point average for diploma graduates will 
          change if St. Olaf courses that qualify for inclusion in the grade point 
          average are subsequently taken but honor designation and rank in class 
          will remain as they were recorded on the date of graduation.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">Neither senior status, number of courses attempted, time 
          spent in college, delays in submitting off-campus or transfer work, 
          nor other circumstances or miscommunication eliminate the 33 full-course 
          requirement. The 33 credits must be fulfilled and recorded before the 
          day of Commencement. The responsibility for understanding and meeting 
          graduation requirements rests entirely with the student.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="body">In Fall Semester, the Registrar's Office conducts a review 
          for each senior who has applied to graduate. A senior who will not meet 
          the requirements stated for participation in Commencement will be notified 
          that he/she has been removed from the list of graduating seniors. Seniors 
          should be cautious about changing registration in the last semester 
          of the senior year. Any change that brings a senior below the stated 
          requirements for participation will result in the student being dropped 
          from the graduating class.</p>
        <p class="body">Past experience leads the college to believe that seniors 
          should be cautious about taking courses S/U. A U designation does not 
          carry credit and will not be changed to another type of grade for graduation 
          credit at a later date. An S grade may not fulfill a General Education 
          requirement.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">DEGREES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Baccalaureate degrees and degree requirements are 
          defined only in this catalog and the <i>Catalog Supplement</i>.<br>
          Should a student desire to earn both the B.A. degree and the B.M. degree 
          at St. Olaf, he/she must complete a minimum of 43 credits, with the
