          In the summer, the office closes daily at 4:30 p.m. and is closed after

        <p class="body">During the regular academic year, students may make appointments 
          with staff members Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m., or at other times 
          by arrangement. Student inquiries relating to private/personal academic

          <span class="goldhead">REGISTRATION</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Course credits cannot be earned unless a student 
          is officially registered with the college for courses actually taken. 
          Registration for courses and sections is made only through the Registrar's 
          Office. Informal arrangements, including section changes, between a 
          student and an instructor do not constitute official registration. Registration 
          does not go into effect until the student has made arrangements for 
          financial charges with the Business Office.<br>
          <br>
          College-wide registrations are held three times each year: September 
          (new students) for Fall Semester, November/December for Interim and 
          Spring Semester and April/May (currently enrolled students) for Fall 
          Semester and Summer School. New students, students not enrolled during 
          the previous semester and students returning from off-campus programs 
          may register in the opening days of each term. Specific registration 
          dates are posted on the academic calendar. Note that students must have 
          settled their tuition bills with the Business Office to be able to register 
          for a term.</span></p>
        <p class="body">Students must register in person or through a proxy at 
          times appointed to each by the registrar. Appointments are rotated alphabetically 
          from registration to registration so no one group of students is consistently 
          first, last or in the middle of the registration schedule. Special arrangements 
          are made for disabled students. Failure to register at the appointed 
          time may result in a limited selection of courses. Part-time students, 
          high school honors students and other &quot;special status&quot; students 
          register on the first day of classes each term at the registrar's window. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Students should consult the Registrar's Office web page 
          to verify the courses for which they are registered and to inspect their 
          degree audits. Schedule errors and/or corrections to the record should 
          be made at the registrar's window immediately.</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body"><b>Procedure:</b><br>
            Registration is made only on an official registration form sent to 
            each student's faculty adviser two weeks prior to registration. Advisers 
            notify students or post appointment times for discussion and the transfer 
            of the signed registration form to the student to bring to registration. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Students going on off-campus programs must register for the program 
            at registration. If the program includes an Interim, registration 
            must be made at both the semester and the Interim registrations.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="body"><b>Changes in Registration:</b><br>
            Students may change their course registration up until the deadline 
            posted on the academic calendar or on the posted registrar's calendar. 
            Registration changes (adding or dropping courses, S/U changes, etc.) 
            are processed with drop/add slips available from, and returnable to, 
            the Registrar's Office. The date the signed slip is returned to the 
            Registrar's Office, not the date it was signed, determines whether 
            the change meets the deadline. An unauthorized withdrawal results 
            in a failure in the course. Being on a closed-course waiting list 
            does not negate the deadline for adding a course. <br>
            <br>
            If a student drops a performance studies course (lessons) after the 
            first day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made.<br>
            <br>
            Requests to change registration after deadlines are made on a petition 
            form available from, and returnable to the Registrar's Office. Such 
            petitions, including assigning handling fees, are acted on by the 
            registrar. The student may appeal a decision on a petition to the 
            Curriculum and Educational Policies Committee, whose decisions are 
            final. Petitioners may call at the registrar's window the day following 
            the committee meeting for information concerning action taken on a 
            petition.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="goldhead">CLASS AND LAB SCHEDULES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">The <i>Class and Lab Schedules</i> are published 
          three times a year: August, November and April. The schedules list the 
          titles, times, and meeting places of all courses offered during the 
          next academic term. All issues also designate dates for final exams.</span></p>
        <p class="body"> The schedules indicate amounts of credit and the requirements 
          that a particular course fulfills. Should a schedule be found in error 
          with regard to course credit, the registrar maintains a master course 
          file for reference and inspection.</p>
        <p><br>
          <span class="goldhead">DEADLINES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Deadlines pertaining to courses and academic procedures 
          are posted on the academic calendar. Academic deadlines are set by the 
          St. Olaf faculty upon recommendation of the Curriculum and Educational 
          <br>
          Policies Committee. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">ADDING COURSES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">A student may add a course until the deadline specified 
          on the academic calendar or in the registrar's calendar by submitting 
          to the Registrar's Office an appropriately signed drop/add slip. Late 
          additions may be petitioned to the registrar and a handling fee may 
          be assigned. Note that no course addition will be permitted that creates 
          an overload for the term.</span></p>
        <p class="body">A student who has been placed on an instructor's waiting 
          list, and who subsequently gains entry into a previously closed course, 
          must officially add the course at the Registrar's Office by the posted 
          add deadline. </p>
        <p class="body">Note that first-half and second-half semester courses 
          have posted deadlines different from those for semester-length courses. 
          Consult the academic calendar. </p>
        <p class="body">Performance studies lessons can be added only with a music 
          lesson drop/add slip available from the Music Office. This drop/add 
          slip must be processed by the Music Department secretary before it will 
          be accepted at the Registrar's Office.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">DROPPING COURSES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">A student may drop (withdraw from) any course for 
          which he/she is registered until the deadline for dropping a course 
          posted in the academic calendar in this catalog or in the Catalog Supplement. 
          A student under review for an honor code violation may not drop the 
          course in question unless a withdrawal is authorized by the student 
          honor council.</span></p>
        <p class="body">A drop/add slip, available from and returnable to the 
          registrar's window, must be properly signed by the instructor whose 
          course is being dropped. Post-deadline changes require a special petition 
          and may result in a handling fee. An unauthorized withdrawal results 
          in a failure in the course.</p>
        <p class="body">Note that first-half and second-half semester courses 
          have deadlines different from those deadlines for courses that last 
          the entire semester.</p>
        <p class="body">If a student adds a course which creates a course overload, 
          he/she must drop a course to make room for the addition by the add deadline 
          posted on the college calendar.</p>
        <p class="body">If a student drops a performance studies course after 
          the first day of class, no refund of music lesson fees is made.<br>
          A student must be registered for at least 3.00 credits in order to retain 
          full-time status, and to receive veteran's benefits. Four full courses 
          are required to maintain certain forms of State of Minnesota financial 
          aid. Degree candidate students dropping below the three-full-course 
          minimum during a semester may lose housing (resident hall) privileges 
          and financial aid. Students considering this option should consult with 
          the Dean of Students Office before taking final action. </p>
        <p class="body">Students dropping a Carleton College course for which 
          they are registered should consult &quot;Carleton Inter-Registration&quot; 
          in this manual.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">LATE ADD (COURSES)</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Students desiring to add a course after the posted 
          deadline may petition with a form available from, and returned in person 
          to, the registrar's window. The petition form must be signed by the 
          instructor of the added course, the student's adviser and the student. 
          Note that petitioning to add a course late without previous attendance 
          may make taking the course more difficult; the instructor, therefore, 
          must verify that the student has sufficient time to make up the work 
          missed. </span></p>
        <p class="body">A student who mistakenly attends a different section of 
          a course from the section registered must petition for a change in registration. 
          The instructor for both sections must verify the error. A student may 
          not subsequently request an incomplete grade for a course added late 
          because of insufficient time to complete the assigned work.</p>
        <p class="body">Being placed on a waiting list for entry into a closed 
          course does not negate the need to register properly for the course 
          before the deadline for adding a course.</p>
        <p class="body">Note that a handling fee may be assigned for accepted 
          petitions.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">LATE DROP (COURSES)</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Students desiring to drop a course after the posted 
          deadline may petition with a form available from, and returned in person 
          to, the registrar's window. The petition form must be signed by the 
          instructor of the course and the student's adviser. An unreported drop 
          or withdrawal results in an F in the course. If the petition is granted, 
          a notation of WP or WF will be made on the student's transcript to indicate 
          whether the student was doing passing or failing work at the time that 
          the course was dropped.</span></p>
        <p class="body">If a student is dropping a course he/she never attended, 
          the instructor must verify the absence from the class.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">REPEATING A COURSE</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">A course may be repeated only once, only at St. 
          Olaf, and only when the grade is C- or below, U or N. A course cannot 
          be repeated after satisfactory completion of any course in the same 
          department or program for which the repeated course is considered a 
          prerequisite. A repeated course may be taken S/U only if the course 
          was originally taken S/U and a U was received. If a course receives 
          an S credit, it may not be repeated regardless of the actual reported 
          grade. A course may earn only one credit once completed with a passing 
          grade of D- or higher. Each course attempt remains part of the permanent 
          record, but only the second grade is computed into the grade point average</span></p>
        <p class="body">Students projecting grade point averages where the projection 
          involves repeating a course should consult with the Registrar's Office. 
          See individual department listings for policies relating to specific 
          departments.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">S/U OPTION (SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY)</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Students may take six of the 35 required courses 
          on an S/U basis. The intent of this option is to allow students to explore 
          areas in which they have an interest, without the grade counting in 
          their GPA.</span></p>
        <p class="body">All courses are open to the S/U option as distinguished 
          from P/N (pass/no pass) courses where the ungraded option is mandatory. 
          Neither an S nor a U figure into the grade point average. An S is awarded 
          for a grade of C- or higher; a U represents a grade of D+ or lower. 
          A U does not earn course credit.</p>
        <p><span class="subhead">The S/U Provisions For All Students Are:</span><br>
          <span class="body">In completing the minimum of 35 full courses required 
          for graduation, students may take up to six full course equivalents 
          on an S/U basis. The seventh course and courses beyond seven taken with 
          an S grade are non-credit events.</span></p>
        <p class="body">Of courses taken to meet General Education requirements, 
          only .25 credit courses may be taken on an S/U basis. Such courses are 
          counted toward the six full credit course equivalents allowed. Full 
          or .50 credit courses taken S/U do not fulfill General Education requirements. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">A maximum of one full course equivalent taken S/U may 
          count toward the minimum requirements for a major or an interdisciplinary 
          concentration. Individual departments may have stricter rules.</p>
        <p class="body">The 24-graded-course requirement must be observed.<br>
          Students may elect to change the grading option from graded to S/U or 
          from S/U to graded through the deadlines designated at the Registrar's 
          office as posted on the college calendar.</p>
        <p class="body">Courses taken S/U on St. Olaf off-campus programs count 
          toward the six full-course equivalents allowed. This use of S/U is distinguished 
          from off-campus courses offered P/N only. </p>
        <p class="body">Students going on non-St. Olaf off-campus programs may 
          be subject to a reduced number of S/U courses and should consult with 
          the registrar in advance.</p>
        <p class="body">Students transferring to St. Olaf, or transferring work 
          taken at other institutions after entering St. Olaf, may be subject 
          to additional S/U restrictions and should consult with the registrar 
          in advance.</p>
        <p class="body">A course completed on an S/U basis may not be assigned 
          another type of grade at a later date. If a student receives an S credit 
          in a course, that course may not be repeated regardless of the actual 
          reported grade.</p>
        <p class="body">No indication of S/U registration is made on a professor's 
          class list.</p>
        <p class="body">Some courses are offered on the P/N basis only upon previous 
          approval of the dean of the college; announcement is made in the <i>Class 
          and Lab Schedule</i>.</p>
        <p><br>
          <span class="goldhead">S/U CHANGES </span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Deadlines for changing courses from S/U to graded 
          or from graded to S/U are designated on the academic calendars in this 
          catalog and in the Catalog Supplement. Students may change a course 
          registered graded to S/U and S/U to graded through the posted deadline. 
          </span></p>
        <p class="body">The date the S/U slip or a subsequent petition is submitted 
          to the registrar, rather than the date it was signed, determines if 
          the request meets the deadline. Students wishing to make an S/U change 
          after the posted deadline may petition to do so on a petition form available 
          at, and returned to, the registrar's window. Students may appeal a denied 
          petition to the curriculum and educational policies committee by resubmitting 
          the petition to the registrar. Decisions of the committee are final.</p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">U GRADES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Under the S/U option, a U will be assigned for any 
          grade of D+ or lower. A student earning a grade of D+ to F in a course 
          taken S/U receives a U, which carries no credit. A U cannot be assigned 
          another type of grade at a later date.</span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">CLOSED COURSES</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">At registration courses may be closed to additional 
          enrollment by the department chair or interdisciplinary program director. 
          The registrar will keep a waiting list for each course during registration. 
          Waiting lists will be turned over to instructors at the end of the registration 
          period. Thereafter an instructor may add a student to a course by signing 
          a drop/add slip returnable by the student to the registrar's window 
          before the posted add deadline. <br>
          Placement on an instructor's wait list does not negate the college-wide 
          deadline for adding a course, nor the need to submit a signed drop/add 
          slip. </span></p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">PROXY REGISTRATION</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">Students away on St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus programs 
          may have a resident student proxy register for them for the next term. 
          Likewise, students unable to register at their scheduled registration 
          time may have a proxy register for them for the next term.</span></p>
        <p class="body">A proxy may not request another student's transcript or 
          degree audit from the registrar. Rather the off-campus student should 
          make arrangements to share academic and course information with his/her 
          proxy. </p>
        <p><span class="goldhead">WAITING LISTS</span></p>
        <p><span class="body">A waiting list to enroll in a course closed at registration 
          is an informal arrangement between a student and the instructor of the 
          course. The arrangement does not negate the college-wide deadline for 
          adding a course or constitute a promise on the part of the college that 
          a closed course will be open at a later date. </span></p>
        <p class="body">The Registrar's Office turns over waiting lists to instructors 
          at the end of each registration. </p>
