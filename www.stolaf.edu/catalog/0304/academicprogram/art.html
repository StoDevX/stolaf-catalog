An outstanding,               professionally active faculty, an excellent art curriculum and a               fine exhibition program in Flaten Art Museum provide a wide range               of offerings in studio art, art history and art education.The mission               of the Department of Art and Art History at St. Olaf College is               to provide liberal arts students with opportunities to experience,               create, view and learn about visual images so they may better understand               themselves and the role of art-making in a global society. The department's               traditional commitment to art history, foundation design and technical               expertise combines with the challenge of teaching critical thinking,               creative innovation and exploring new ideas in visual media. An               independent, national publication, Ruggs' Guide to Undergraduate               Education, recognizes the strength of the St. Olaf art program by               naming it as one of the 30 most selective undergraduate art programs               in the country. Art graduates have received national acclaim in               many professional fields across the country -- museum and gallery               administration, advertising, architecture, computer graphics, graphic               design, illustration, animation and film-making, studio art and               teaching. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS</p>            <p class="goldsubhead"> Requirements for a Studio Major</p>            <p class="body"> Students majoring in studio art must earn a minimum               of nine credits including Art 343. Students may elect courses equaling               two history and seven studio or three history and six studio. (All               foundations count toward the major and the department strongly recommends               Art 252 and 253 as part of the art history taken). All majors must               take four foundations, including one three-dimensional course (choose               from 114, 116, 119, 121 or 122) and one drawing course (choose from               110, 111, 112 or 125) unless a major qualifies for and takes Art               120; then two additional courses must be taken, one of them a three-dimensional               course from 114, 116, 119, or Interim 121 or 122. Two courses must               be selected from (221 or 222), (223 or 224), (226 or 227), 228,               230, 232, 234, 238, and 239. (Interim foundations count toward the               foundations requirement.) Students with considerable experience               in studio art are encouraged to seek placement in Art 120: Honors               Foundation Drawing; they will be admitted only by portfolio and/or               slide review during first-year orientation week. Time and place               will be posted.</p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for an Art History Major</p>            <p class="body"> Students majoring in art history must earn nine credits               in the following: (1-2) 150, 151; (3-6) A minimum of four courses               chosen from among Art 250-275 (a maximum of two courses in art history               taken in off-campus programs may, upon approval of the department,               be applied to the major); (7) Two half-credit courses in studio               art; (8) At least one course treating art from a theoretical perspective,               chosen from among Art 270: Issues in Art Criticism, Environmental               Studies 275: Nature and American Landscapes, and Philosophy 243:               Aesthetics. (It is recommended that a student take Art 150: Ancient               Through Medieval Art and Art 151: Renaissance to the Present as               early as possible); and (9) Art 350: The Methods of Art History.</p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Visual Arts Education Teaching               Major</p>            <p class="body"> Students undertaking a visual arts education teaching               major complete the graduation studio major, plus three additional               courses in art and the required Education Department courses, and               participate in the junior review. A minimum of 12 total credits               in art is required: three in art history and nine in studio.

Internship opportunities are possible in specialized fields               of study that involve students in the workaday professional art               world. Both art history and studio students can take advantage of               the Minneapolis Art Institute, the Walker Art Center and other Minneapolis-St.               Paul art institutions. Studio majors also can gain professional               experience in the Twin Cites in the areas of graphic design, illustration,               architecture, etc.</p>            <p class="subhead">Interdisciplinary Studies</p>            <p class="body"> The Department of Art and Art History is committed               to a dialogue among the fine arts and participates in the interdisciplinary               fine arts major.
