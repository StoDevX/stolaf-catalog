The college also ranks in the top five as a source of students               who obtain the Ph.D. in chemistry and related fields. Chemistry               faculty members have a fine record of achievement in teaching and               research; several have won prestigious national awards. Students               enjoy state-of-the-art instrumentation and computers in both laboratory               and classroom. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The Chemistry Department offers courses               not only in the traditional major areas of chemistry (organic, analytical,               physical, inorganic, biochemistry), but also in interdisciplinary               areas that are developing rapidly, such as molecular biology and               organometallic chemistry. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The department has an active summer               research program, in which faculty and students work together to               investigate problems of current interest. Students graduating with               chemistry majors have had excellent success in gaining admission               to graduate and professional schools and in obtaining employment               opportunities. A major in chemistry may lead to employment in chemical               research and in related areas such as medical applications of chemistry,               environmental chemistry and materials science. A chemistry major               also provides an excellent background for continued education in               professional schools in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and related               fields. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Graduation Major </p>            <p class="body">Majors must complete Chemistry 125 (or 121 and 123),               126, 247, 248, 255, 371, laboratory courses 253, 254, 256, 357,               and one additional course from 252, 333, 372, 379, 380, 382, 386               or 388. In addition, students majoring in chemistry must take either               Physics 124L and 125L (2.0 credits), or Physics 126L, 127L, and               228/229L (3.25 credits); Mathematics through courses 126 or 128;               and attendance during junior and senior years at 12 departmental               seminars. Completion of at least one course credit in independent               research <span class="change-red">(or having a summer research experience)</span>               is strongly recommended for students planning careers in chemistry.             </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Physical Science Teacher               Major (with a chemistry concentration) </p>            <p class="body">A chemistry major who wishes to teach chemistry in               schools (5-12) must hold a valid Minnesota teaching license in physical               science with a chemistry concentration. In addition to the chemistry               major, additional science courses and the professional education               sequence are required. Interested students should consult with a               faculty advisor in the Education Department for details of requirements               and available options. A physical science teaching minor is available.             </p>            <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL               STUDY </p>            <p class="body">St. Olaf College is accredited by the American Chemical               Society through its Committee on Professional Training. Prospective               majors in chemistry who expect to comply with the minimum requirements               of the committee will take the following courses: Chemistry 125               (or 121 and 123), 126, 247, 248, 253, 254, 255, 256, 357, 371, 379,               380, 382, 378, 386 and one additional laboratory course selected               from 373, 374, 375 or 376. Laboratory research experience may substitute               for the additional laboratory course requirement with permission               of the department chair. In addition, ACS-certified majors are required               to take two mathematics courses beyond calculus II (Mathematics               126 or 128). This requirement is typically fulfilled by taking Mathematics               220 and one of Mathematics 226 or 230.</p>            <p class="body"> Students planning graduate work in chemistry should               complete most of these courses, even if they do not fulfill all               of the requirements for ACS certification. In particular, students               interested in graduate school should take Chemistry 386 by the end               of the junior year so that they have taken the background courses               relevant to the Chemistry Graduate Record Examination prior to fall               of the senior year, when that examination is typically taken.</p>            <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION </p>            <p class="body">The Chemistry Department seeks to encourage and recognize               students who give evidence of creative and independent scholarship.               A variety of opportunities are available for students to take a               much greater responsibility for setting their goals and realizing               the achievements of their education.
