            <p class="programdescription">History explores the many facets of 
              the human condition from the past to the present. History invites 
              those who study it to develop an appreciation for the variety of 
              human experiences. Demonstrating how the past shapes the present, 
              the study of history also encourages an understanding of different 
              world cultures, societies and outlooks in their own terms. Students 
              learn to analyze and to think critically about a broad range of 
              historical issues and experiences. They also learn how to develop 
              reasoned arguments and explanations from historical evidence.</p>
            <p class="programdescription"> Among St. Olaf departments, the History 
              Department is distinctive in the variety of required or optional 
              courses it offers for the college's interdisciplinary programs. 
              These courses are described here; and they are also listed in such 
              program descriptions as American Studies, Asian Studies, Environmental 
              Studies and Women's Studies. In addition, history courses fulfill 
              different general education requirements, according to subject matter. 
              The department is a major provider of HWC, MCS-G, MCS-D and WRI 
              courses. Some history courses count toward ALS-L and HBS. </p>
            <p class="programdescription">The study of history provides students 
              with liberal arts preparation for a wide range of professional and 
              personal vocations. Most history majors pursue careers in such fields 
              as business, education, law and government service. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>
            <p> <span class="body">St. Olaf's history offerings are structured 
              to help students achieve different learning goals at different levels. 
              In Level I seminars, students approach history as a way of learning, 
              through a variety of historical topics and through the reading of 
              primary sources. In Foundation Courses, they explore the broad historical 
              development of the world's major societies and cultures. In Level 
              II courses, students examine more specialized national, area and 
              topical developments. Finally, Level III seminars challenge students 
              to recognize historical problems and to formulate their own questions 
              about history, historiography and historical methods. </span></p>
            <p class="body">History courses at Levels I and II generally do not 
              have prerequisites. Level I seminars are only open to first-year 
              students. Before entering Level III courses, students with little 
              or no background in a particular area or period should consult with 
              the instructor. </p>
            <p class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
            <p class="body"> History majors are required to take nine courses, 
              including three courses at Level III. One Level I seminar and two 
              Level I Foundation Courses may be counted toward the major. Students 
              must take at least one course in each of three general areas, i.e., 
              Europe, United States and the non-Western world (Africa, Asia, Latin 
              America). At least two courses must deal with the pre-modern period. 
              The following courses count toward this requirement: 101, 102, <span class="change-red">103,</span> 
              105, 106, 107, <span class="change-red">115,</span> 130, 131, 190, 
              <span class="change-red">191,</span> 195, <span class="change-red">196,</span> 
              205, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 220, 221, 222, 225, 226, 230, 231, 
              235, 240, 242, 246, 248, 259, 260, 262, 266, 270, 275, 277, 281, 
              302, 303, 309. Other courses may meet this requirement if approved 
              by the department chair.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION</p>
            <p class="body"> Senior majors who seek a significant intellectual 
              experience and who demonstrate high achievement in historical research 
              and writing may apply for departmental distinction. Candidates must 
              satisfy minimum grade point average requirements (3.00 overall, 
              3.50 in the major), prepare a paper under the direction of an adviser 
              in the department and submit their work for faculty review. Students 
              declare their interest to the department chair or the instructor 
              of the senior thesis seminar <span class="change-strikethrough">early 
              in the second semester </span> <span class="change-red">by Dec. 
              15</span> of their senior year. The formal review begins in early 
              April. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </p>
            <p class="body">The History Department supports several other programs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> The social studies education (see Social Studies 
                Education description) major with a primary core in history is 
                appropriate for those considering a career in high school teaching. 
                In addition to the general requirements for the social studies 
                education major (see Education catalog description and faculty), 
                students in this major are required to complete a primary core 
                that includes History 191 and another course in European history; 
                History 205 and 206; and History 196 or a course in Asian, African,

              <li class="body"> The interdisciplinary historical perspectives

              <li class="body"> The Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) 
                program offers students opportunities to integrate their foreign-language 
                skills with the study of history. Students in specially designated 
                history classes can use their Spanish, French, German, Russian 
                or Chinese so that nothing is lost to them in the translation!</li>

              during World War II through short stories, novels and film (all 
              in English translation). Defeated and in disarray, the French transferred 
              their struggle to the realm of culture. Through literature they 
              sought explanations, assigned blame, developed strategies for survival 
              and ultimately for resistance. Students also examine literary (re)interpretations

              The immigration of people from around the globe has been central

              on the dawn of the 20th and 21st centuries, as the immigrants' point
