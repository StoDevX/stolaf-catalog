The Management Studies Program               also supports the management and finance areas of emphasis within               the economics major (see Department of Economics). </p>            <p class="programdescription">To meet the challenges of an ever-changing               world, graduates must be ready to take advantage of opportunities               and create their own success. A St. Olaf liberal arts education               encourages students to view the world from multiple perspectives,               build fundamental communication and problem-solving skills, wrestle               with questions of ethics and develop a global perspective. The management               studies concentration connects theory and practice and helps students               make the transition from college to career. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The management studies concentration               prepares students for careers in domestic and international business,               not-for-profit and governmental organizations and entrepreneurial               ventures. Students direct their efforts by choosing elective courses               and experiences that focus on a special area of interest. For example:               a student who hopes to start a business can elect to take Management               Students 256 (Entrepreneurship), participate in the special Estenson               Internship Program which provides a paid summer internship in an               entrepreneurial firm and apply for a Finstad Office grant to pursue               a business idea.

Core courses for the management               studies concentration include Economics 121 or 122, Management Studies               225 and 251. Electives include an additional management studies               course and an approved course from another department on campus               or a study abroad program. Students must earn a grade of C or better               in the five courses. </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Experiential Learning: </p>            <p class="body">This component is met by completing two approved experiences               in which the student applies management or financial principles               to real world problems. One of the activities must be an Academic               or Recognition Internship or an approved work experience. The other               activity can be a volunteer, leadership, entrepreneurial or related               work experience. The Internship Office, Career Connections Center,               Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial Studies and other organizations               help students complete this requirement. </p>            <p class="goldsubhead"> The Electronic Integrative Folder: </p>            <p class="body">The Electronic Integrative Folder introduces a career               planning process where experiential learning complements academic               learning and where the systematic development of interests, skills               and abilities helps students to identify career options and access               opportunities. The Integrative Folder is presented on a CD that               demonstrates the the inter-relatedness of the student's varied learning               experiences at St. Olaf. It includes the results of self-assessment               and career exploration activities, a description of the future goals,               an academic and experiential action plan and projects, papers and               other work that demonstrate specific skill development. The electronic               format allows students to demonstrate tangible connections toward               meeting the stated goals by interconnecting important pieces in               a digital folder.</p>            <p class="goldhead">FINSTAD OFFICE FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL STUDIES</p>            <p class="body"> The Paul and Anne Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial               Studies promotes growth and dissemination of information about entrepreneurship               in society.
