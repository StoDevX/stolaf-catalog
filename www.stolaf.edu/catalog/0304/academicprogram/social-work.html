        <p class="faculty"><b>Faculty, 2002-03:</b> Naurine Lennox (Family and 
          Social Service), social service systems and history, rural practice,

        <p class="programdescription">St. Olaf students prepare for lives of service 
          as responsible and knowledgeable citizens. Those who study social work 
          are committed to enhancing human well-being and alleviating suffering. 
          Social work, a program in the Department of Family and Social Service, 
          builds on students' liberal education by enabling them to critically 
          examine need, illumine inherent human strengths, reflect on their ethical 
          conduct and explore policies and programs that address social problems. 
          The program mission is to prepare students to ethically serve diverse 
          populations and promote a just global community. Completing a bachelor 
          of arts degree in social work prepares students for beginning generalist 
          professional practice with diverse clients, both rural and urban. The 
          Council on Social Work Education accredited the program in 1990; graduates 
          are certified for the state licensure examination at the baccalaureate 
          level. </p>
        <p class="programdescription">Courses meet WRI, MCS-G, HBS-E and ORC and 
          are appropriate for students who are interested in social welfare, the 
          Peace Corps or related areas like psychology, education, church work 
          and human resources. Level 300 courses are reserved for majors. </p>
        <p class="programdescription">Students considering social work graduate 
          school are strongly encouraged to consult faculty about appropriate 
          undergraduate courses. The program provides preparation for graduate 
          study in marriage and family counseling, policy, ministry, special education, 
          law and related fields. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>
        <p class="body"> Social work education builds on the liberal arts with 
          professional foundation courses. It prepares for generalist practice 
          students who understand scientific approaches to knowledge building 
          and practice, are reflective of and responsible for their own ethical 
          conduct and are committed to lives of service and leadership in the 
          global community. Courses are sequential, culminating with the 400-hour 
          field practicum and capstone course with a project. Students gain experience 
          with individuals, groups, families, organizations and communities in 
          settings as diverse as child welfare, health and corrections. Practicums 
          are in the nearby communities; placement elsewhere can be arranged.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>
        <p class="body">Those interested in the major should contact the program 
          director in their first year or as early as possible. Students in good 
          standing at the college who have satisfactorily completed prerequisite 
          courses and Social Work 221 are eligible to apply for admission to the 
          program. Students are granted major status only after satisfactory completion 
          of Social Work 221, 246, 254 and a program application. Students must 
          achieve a grade of C or better in all required courses to progress in 
          the program. Details are available in the Program Handbook available 
          from faculty.</p>
        <p class="goldsubhead">Prerequisite Courses Required for the Major</p>
        <p class="body"> The required courses are Sociology 121 or 126; Psychology 
          125 and 241, and Biology 123 or 243. </p>
        <p class="goldsubhead"> Foundation Social Work Courses Required for the 
          Major</p>
        <p class="body"> The required courses are 221, 246, 254, 258, 261, 274, 
          373, 380 and 381. Students must be admitted to the social work program 
          and in good academic standing to register for all 300 level courses. 
          A global component must be completed prior to Social Work 380 (see Program 
          Handbook for details). A field practicum of at least 400 clock hours 
          (Social Work 380 block practicum), professionally supervised in an affiliated 
          agency, is required during fall semester of the senior year. Social 
          Work 373 and 380 together constitute a full semester's work (3.5 
          credits). Field practicum experience may be completed while living on 
          or off campus. Statistics 110 is recommended, especially for students 
          who anticipate graduate study. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">ADMISSION TO AND RETENTION IN THE SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM 
        </p>
        <p class="body">The program actively seeks and encourages students from 
          diverse backgrounds to consider a social work major and provides one-to-one 
          advising. </p>
        <p class="body">First- and second-year students interested in social work 
          are encouraged to submit an Interest Inventory. It is in the Program 
          Handbook, available from program faculty. The program application, admission 
          requirements, requirements for remaining in good standing in the program, 
          processes for petitioning reinstatement and grievance procedures for 
          redress of any adverse decision are also in the handbook. The program 
          does not discriminate against any student on the basis of race, gender, 
          ethnicity, culture, class, religion, national origin, age, physical 
          or mental ability, sexual orientation, public assistance status or geographic 
          location. Students are formally notified of admission to the program 
          prior to registration spring semester of the junior year. </p>
        <p><span class="body">Students who transfer to St. Olaf at or before the 
          beginning of the junior (third) year may be considered for admission 
          to the program, providing they have completed equivalent prerequisite 
          courses in sociology, psychology and human biology. Field practicum 
          and methods courses must be completed while enrolled at St. Olaf. No 
          credit or waiver is given for previous internship or work experience 
          nor for life experience. </span> </p>
        <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </p>
        <p class="body">The St. Olaf Social Work Program encourages student participation 
          in off-campus programs, both domestic and international. Majors can 
          conveniently schedule an Interim abroad, including Social Work 256: 
          Family Social Services in Central Mexico and Family Studies 263: Aboriginal 
          Cultures in Australia. To participate in a semester program off-campus 
          (e.g., HECUA in South America, ACM Chicago Urban Studies, Indonesia 
          or Mexico) and complete the program requirements in four years, students 
          must plan early and carefully with the help of social work faculty. 
          St. Olaf Study Service in Indonesia is an exciting option for sophomore 
          majors in the spring semester. </p>
        <p class="body">Students often count social work courses for family studies 
          and other interdisciplinary majors and concentrations including American 
          racial and multicultural studies, and women's studies.</p>
        <p class="body"> Social work faculty occasionally work with students in 
          independent projects in social welfare and social service. Completing 
          the social work major is possible only through the regular college, 
          however. </p>

          a strengths perspective, social work majors apply prerequisite and advanced 
          theoretical research material from biology, sociology and psychology
