            <p class="programdescription">From the molecules that are the building 
              blocks of life to the complex interactions between living beings 
              and our environment, biology continues to fascinate the human mind. 
              The Biology Department offers a diverse array of courses and experiences 
              that present fundamental biological principles and processes within 
              the context of being informed, responsible and compassionate citizens. 
              It provides a broad range of learning opportunities through its 
              course offerings, laboratories, independent study/research, internships 
              and off-campus study programs at sites including South India, Arizona, 
              Costa Rica, Australia, Bahamas, Galapagos Islands and Northern Minnesota. 
              Woven into all learning opportunities are hands-on experiences using 
              modern equipment that stimulate critical and independent thinking.</p>
            <p class="programdescription"> For science majors, the Biology Department 
              offers an exciting slate of challenging and rewarding courses. For 
              the less science-oriented student, it seeks to quench the natural 
              curiosity about how our bodies work and how humans interact with 
              their surroundings by providing several courses designed primarily 
              for non-science majors. These courses, which satisfy the Studies 
              in Natural Sciences requirement of the General Education curriculum, 
              focus on current biological issues and general interest topics in 
              biology. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE BIOLOGY MAJOR </p>
            <p class="body">The ever-broadening nature of biology requires diversely 
              trained and inquisitive biologists. The biology major has the dual 
              mission of introducing students to the information and technological 
              tools of various disciplines of biology while instilling the confidence 
              to critically assess a biological phenomenon and to design and carry 
              out an appropriate experiment. To that end, the biology major provides 
              the necessary content and instrument training to enable students 
              to practice the art of scientific inquiry. Biology majors are encouraged 
              to participate in faculty-based research, off-campus programs in 
              biology and in departmental seminars and social activities.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS OF THE BIOLOGY MAJOR</p>
            <p> <span class="body">Students majoring in biology must complete 
              eight biology courses and one year of chemistry courses (Chemistry 
              121, 123, 126, or 125, 126). The eight biology courses must include: 
              four core courses that emphasize cell/molecular biology (Biology 
              125), biodiversity and evolution (Biology 126), genetics (Biology 
              233), and ecology (Biology 261); one course that focuses on the 
              structure/function of a group of multicellular organisms (Biology 
              242, 247, 248, 251, 252, or 266); one Level III Biology course; 
              two elective biology courses. </span></p>
            <p class="body">The following courses can count as biology electives: 
              Biochemistry (Chemistry 379), Biosphere Ecology (Environmental Studies 
              260), Conservation Biology (Environmental Studies 125), Neuroscience 
              (Neuroscience 234), Physiology of Exercise (Physical Education 375), 
              Biopsychology (Psychology 238), Comparative Psychology (Psychology 
              382) and Human Neuropsychology (Psychology 385) or other courses 
              as approved by petition to the department. For two of these courses 
              to count, they must be from different departments or programs. No 
              more than three Level I biology courses, including Biology 125 and 
              126, can count toward the major. Only Biology Department courses 
              (including IRs) may count toward the Level III requirement.</p>
            <p class="body"> Students wishing to count for the major a course 
              taken abroad or at another institution should consult with the chair 
              before taking the class.</p>
            <p class="body"> While programs leading to graduate work are planned 
              on an individual basis, students should have one or two courses 
              in mathematics, two courses in physics, at least four courses in 
              chemistry and a course in statistics. </p>
            <p class="body">Students intending to enter graduate or professional 
              school are encouraged to consult with the biology faculty to plan 
              a course of study appropriate for the postgraduate program. Students 
              pursuing a secondary school Science Education Teaching License with 
              a Life Science Specialty must complete the biology major including 
              Biology 123 or 243 as one of their electives. Additional courses 
              are required as specified by the Education Department. Interested 
              students should consult faculty in the Education Department. </p>
            <p><span class="body">The prerequisite for Genetics (Biology 233), 
              Microbiology (Biology 231) and Human Anatomy and Physiology (Biology 
              243) is Biology 125. All other Level II courses have prerequisites 
              of Biology 125 and 126. Only one Independent Study (Biology 298) 
              or Independent Research (Biology 398) can count toward the major;
