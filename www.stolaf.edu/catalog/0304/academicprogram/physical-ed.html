Its aim is the improvement of human performance and the               enhancement of human development through the medium of physical               activity throughout the lifespan. St. Olaf offers an exercise science               major, a variety of activity courses to meet the core curriculum               requirements for graduation, intramural and club sports and 27 varsity               sports. </p>            <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION </p>            <p class="body">Two different one-quarter (0.25) activity courses               from the Departments of Physical Education and/or Dance, or one               one-half (.50) course, from the Department of Physical Education               fulfill the physical activity requirement in the General Education               curriculum. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>            <p> <span class="body">The exercise science major is an in-depth,               multidisciplinary study of human movement and performance in sport-related               fields (10.0 courses, 10 titles). The major supports academic linkages               across disciplines and provides excellent preparation in a wide               variety of fields. It is recommended that this major be complemented               by other majors or concentrations of interest to the student (such               as psychology, management studies, history, women's studies, media               studies, environmental studies, etc.) </span></p>            <p class="body">The required courses are Biology 125 and 243, Psychology               125, Nursing 110, and Physical Education 255, 290, 373, 374, 375,               and 390. The department recommends Physical Education 394 and 398,               Chemistry 121, Psychology 231 and completion of the biomedical concentration.             </p>            <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>            <p class="goldsubhead"> Biomedical Concentration </p>            <p class="body">The biomedical concentration is an interdisciplinary               program with two different tracks (biomedical science and biomedical               studies). The concentration is intended as a plan of study that               will enhance the preparation of students entering careers in the               biomedical arena ranging from medicine to sport science. Students               develop a biomedical concentration by implementing a plan of study               to match their individual needs. Students interested in a concentration               must consult with the biomedical coordinator and develop a contract               near the end of their sophomore year. </p>            <p class="body">The biomedical concentration consists of a minimum               of five courses. All students must take the foundation course, Biology               243 (Human Anatomy and Physiology), or an equivalent course. Core               courses must be taken from three areas of study: practical application,               experiential learning and ethical considerations. See BIOLOGY in               this catalog for more details. </p>            <p class="body">The Physical Education Department offers the following               courses that count toward the biomedical concentration: Physical               Education 255 (Prevention and Care of Athletic Injuries), 373 (Motor               Learning), 374 (Biomechanics) and 375 (Exercise Physiology). Also,               many experiential components that support the biomedical concentration               (such as being a student athletic trainer or interning at a sport               medicine clinic) exist within the Physical Education Department.             </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Coaching Sequence </p>            <p class="body">It is highly recommended that students in all teaching               majors who wish to be employed as a head varsity coach of an interscholastic               sport in a senior high school successfully complete the following               sequence of courses: Physical Education 238, 255, 335, 374 and 375.               Students not in the education teaching track are encouraged to enter               the program if they are interested in becoming an assistant or head               coach.
