These opportunities may include experiencing               the tragic ferocity of the Spanish Civil War in the pages of Sender's               Requiem por un campesino espa&#8211;ol, serving as an interpreter               for a Latino family in Northfield, teaching art to the children               of imprisoned women in Quito, Ecuador, speaking with indigenous               people on the shores of Guatemala's beautiful Lake Atitl&#8225;n               about their struggle to preserve the land, probing the imposing               complexity of Latin American life within the mythic dimensions of               Garcia Marquez' Macondo, debating politics with impassioned university               students in Seville, Spain, or talking into the night with a roommate               from Costa Rica in the Spanish House.
