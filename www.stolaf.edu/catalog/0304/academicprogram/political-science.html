The Political               Science Department seeks to acquaint students with their own political               environment, to alert them to the global dimensions of politics               and public policy and to prepare them for informed and effective               contribution to public life whether as citizens or public officials.               It also assists students by participating in the General Education               curriculum. It offers a number of courses in the areas of Human               Behavior and Society (HBS), Historical Studies in Western culture               (HWC), Multicultural Studies (MCS) and Ethical Issues and Normative               Perspectives (EIN). It shares faculty and courses with Hispanic               Studies, American Studies, Asian Studies, Russian Studies and Environmental               Studies. It also cooperates with the Education Department in its               social studies education major.</p>            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>            <p class="body"> War and peace, taxing and spending, choice and constraint,               dictatorship and democracy -- these and a hundred other realities               of modern life are played out in the realm of domestic and international               politics. In an increasingly complex and interdependent world, public               decision-making requires thoughtful discourse, broad-based participation               and intelligent, responsive leadership. To that end, the Department               of Political Science engages students in the systematic and critical               analysis of government, politics and public policy. It helps students               learn to frame thoughtful questions, conduct imaginative research,               marshal convincing evidence, write with clarity, precision and conviction               and engage in lively conversation. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>            <p> <span class="body">The requirements for a major in political science               are intended to provide broad exposure to the discipline as well               as develop a wide range of research skills. Students majoring in               political science must complete a minimum of nine courses in the               discipline, including no more than three Level I courses, no fewer               than two at Level III, and Political Science 220, &quot;Analyzing               Politics and Policy.&quot;</span></p>            <p class="body"> Majors must include at least one course from each               of the four subfields: American politics and public policy (111,               115, 215, 227, 235, 246, 255, 272, 274, 276, 373); comparative politics               (112, 117, 251, 252, 256, 263, 264, 282, 367, 385, 386, 399); international               relations (121, 230, 254, 257, 258, 281, 283, 383, 388); and political               theory (113, 210, 222, 232, 247, 249, 259, 260, 270, 349, 384).               Beginning in 2002-03, Level III courses will be offered as seminars               with two prerequisites: Political Science 220 and one other course               in the subfield. </p>            <p class="body">Students may also include a selected Statistics course               (110, 212, 263, 266, or 312) OR one extra semester of language (French,               German or Spanish numbered above 232, or Chinese, Greek, Latin,               Japanese, Norwegian or Russian numbered above 231). </p>            <p class="body">Majors in the classes of 2002-04 can also choose to               complete a &quot;simplified old major,&quot; requiring eight courses               within the four-subfield framework and eliminating the major requirement               of a subfield concentration. Beginning in Fall 2002 at least two               Level III courses with prerequisites are required, in addition to               at least one course in each of the four subfields. </p>            <p class="body">Students may also complete work in each area through               independent study and/or research under faculty supervision (298,               398). </p>            <p class="body">Majors in political science may also choose from a               rich assortment of domestic and international off-campus study opportunities               (see Index), only two of which can count towards the major. Further               information on particular programs, especially internships, Interim               off-campus course offerings and the Washington Semester, is available               in the Department of Political Science or from the Office of International               and Off-Campus Studies.
