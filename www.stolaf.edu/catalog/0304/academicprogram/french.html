More than 200 million people around the world               -- in North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the               Middle East, the Pacific and Indian Oceans and Indochina -- speak               French. French remains, with English, one of the two languages into               which all documents must be translated in the United Nations. Thus,               students considering careers in business, diplomacy, the church               or teaching wisely choose to complete a major in French, sometimes               along with another major. </p>            <p class="programdescription">Studying French and other Francophone               cultures, civilizations and literatures, students develop and enhance               oral and written language skills, analytical thinking and familiarity               with diverse philosophies and perspectives, all of which are central               to liberal arts education with a global perspective. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The French section of the Department               of Romance Languages offers a variety of courses, on campus and               abroad, in French language, Francophone cultures/civilizations and               literatures for beginning, intermediate and advanced students, both               majors and non-majors. </p>            <p class="programdescription">To expand students' exposure to French               beyond the formal classroom setting, the department promotes a French               conversation table and sponsors an honor house (Maison fran&#141;aise)               that serves as a focal point for Francophone cultural and social               activities (lectures, films, musical groups, celebrations).</p>            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE FRENCH MAJOR </p>            <p class="body">In courses for the major, students gain understanding               of Francophone literatures, civilizations and contemporary cultures               as they develop analytical and communication skills in the language.             </p>            <p class="body">Level II courses are divided into two sequences. In               250-level courses, students practice and refine their emerging language               skills through close textual analysis. In 270-level courses, students               explore the diverse cultures and literatures of the Francophone               world. </p>            <p class="body">Level III courses build upon the interpretive skills               and knowledge of the Francophone world acquired by students in 270-level               courses. Level III courses examine a particular topic or genre as               well as critical or theoretical issues associated with it through               the analysis of representative works. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </p>            <p class="body">All French majors are urged to study in France or               in another Francophone country. This is particularly important to               French teaching majors and minors. </p>            <p><span class="body">Students who participate in an approved semester-long               St. Olaf study abroad program may count up to two courses in French,               plus one approved course in history, toward the major. Students               who participate in an approved year-long St. Olaf study abroad program               may count up to three courses in French, plus one approved course               in history toward the major. </span> </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Graduation Major: </p>            <p class="body">The graduation major consists of eight courses in               French above French 232 plus a co-curricular requirement in history.               Students must take: two 250-level courses; two 270-level courses,               at least one of which must be taken on campus; two 300-level courses               taken on campus; two French courses of the student's choosing; and               either History 226 or History 235 or an approved history course               taken abroad. Independent study or research may not be counted in               lieu of any of the courses referred to above. </p>            <p class="goldsubhead">Requirements for a Teaching Major: </p>            <p class="body">A student must take: eight courses in French above               232; one approved applied linguistics course (may be taken abroad);               History 226 or 235 or an approved history course taken abroad; and               Education 353 (and other required courses for teacher certification               -- see Department of Education). The eight courses in French above               232 must include one immersion course (French 233, 250, 275, or               other approved immersion course), two 250-level courses, two 270-level               courses, and two 300-level courses. Students not taking an approved               course in applied linguistics abroad must take English 274.
