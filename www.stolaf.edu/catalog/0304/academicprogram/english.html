Literature               offers the pleasures of artistic expression combined with the powerful               consolations of empathy and insight, knowledge and inspiration.             </p>            <p class="programdescription">The English Department offers a major               that, drawing on some 1,500 years of literatures in English, provides               a sound foundation in the history of British and American literature               and introduces students to the more recent, global range of literatures               in English. It contrasts and connects literatures in English across               national boundaries, historical periods, differing cultures and               the various literary genres. Our students read from Geoffrey Chaucer               to China Achebe, from Mary Rowlandson to Jamaica Kincaid; they read               epics, novels and plays, essays and memoirs, lyrics and short stories.             </p>            <p class="programdescription">In discussing and writing on what they               have read, students develop an informed understanding of the force               of literary language and improve their own powers of communication,               analysis and persuasion. In the department's creative writing courses,               students can nourish their own verbal creativity and, perhaps, make               their own contribution to literatures in English. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The English major is easily and frequently               combined with other majors. English courses also count toward Generation               Education requirements (see below) and contribute to a number of               interdisciplinary concentrations, including American Racial and               Multicultural Studies, American Studies, Medieval Studies and Women's               Studies. The English major is very compatible with off-campus and               overseas study (see below under Special Programs), since most courses               taken elsewhere in literature in English can count toward the major               as electives. What can you do with an English major? Students who               wish to teach English at the secondary school level use their major               towards a Communication Arts and Literature License. Most English               majors use their powers of critical thinking, verbal comprehension,               reading, writing and speaking to enter a wide range of jobs, occupations,               training programs and professions. They find what their English               major gave them is good for the marketplace and good for a lifetime.             </p>            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</p>            <p class="body"> The basic English major is nine courses. All majors               complete the same five core courses: an introductory course, 185;               three sequential historical survey courses, 221, 222 and 223; and               the Major Seminar, 399. With the remaining four (or more electives),               one of which should be at Level III, students can pursue their own               particular interests and give their major the emphasis they choose.               There could be a stress on particular authors, historical periods,               genres or topics, or a focus on creative writing. The Major Seminar               contributes to this flexibility, since it allows students to undertake               projects of their own design. </p>            <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION</p>            <p class="body"> Many English courses carry General Education credit.               Beyond First-Year Writing courses, which are taught in large numbers               by English Department faculty, there are courses which offer GE               credit in WRI, ORC, HWC, MCS-G and MCS-D, ALS-L and EIN.</p>            <p class="goldhead">PREREQUISITES</p>            <p class="body"> General Education 111 or its equivalent is a prerequisite               for all other courses in the department except English 107, 110               and some Level I Interim courses. While a few courses have additional               prerequisites, most Level I and Level II courses are open to all               -- majors and non-majors alike -- after General Education 111. Level               III courses (numbered 300 or higher) are primarily for English majors               and ordinarily build upon prior work. All Level III courses require               as a prerequisite English 185 and at least one Level II course in               an area of relevant background as confirmed by the instructor or               the department.</p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS</p>            <p class="goldsubhead"> Requirements for the Graduation Major </p>            <p class="body">Nine courses beyond General Education 111 or equivalent,               including English 185; 221, 222, and 223; 399; four electives (one               of which must be at Level III). <span class="change-strikethrough">Requirements               for the Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure with               an Emphasis in Literature Eight courses beyond General Education               111 or equivalent, including English 185; 221, 222 and 223; 251               or 257; 274, 399 and one English literature elective.
