            <p class="programdescription">The Department of Psychology is committed 
              to maintaining a rigorous academic curriculum within a supportive 
              community structure. It seeks to address broad questions posed by 
              a liberal education and specific concerns of individual students. 
              St. Olaf College's mission statement provides a framework for curriculum, 
              personal development and community relations. Because life is more 
              than facts and theories, the Psychology Department encourages students 
              to be &quot;responsible citizens dedicated to service,&quot; as 
              well as scientific &quot;seekers of truth.&quot; </p>
            <p class="programdescription">Ten psychology courses contribute to 
              General Education by fulfilling both foundation studies (ORC and 
              WRI) and core studies (HBS, NSL, NST, MCS-D, MCS-G). They introduce 
              the disciplinary knowledge that nurtures growth and behavioral change 
              while providing background for advanced study. Psychology contributes 
              to majors in social work, family studies and nursing, to concentrations 
              in linguistics, neuroscience and women's studies and to the psychology 
              core of the social studies education major.</p>
            <p><span class="programdescription"> Psychology majors are prepared 
              for graduate and professional programs in psychology, medicine, 
              law, physical therapy, social work, nursing and ministry and for 
              entering positions in business, government or industry. </span> 
            </p>
            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </p>
            <p class="body">The Department of Psychology follows the American 
              Psychological Association's guidelines of &quot;synthesizing the 
              natural and social science aspects of the discipline, in part, by 
              requiring students to take courses in both knowledge bases.&quot; 
              Thus both interpersonal and investigative skills are enhanced. Students 
              benefit from research in the library, laboratory and field, as well 
              as from internships. Through course structure and faculty diversity, 
              the department challenges students to think critically and creatively 
              as they investigate ways in which animals, especially humans, adapt 
              to their environment through biological, social, emotional, spiritual, 
              perceptual, behavioral, linguistic and cognitive processes. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
            <p> <span class="body">Psychology majors are required to take 12.5 
              courses to complete the major. The major consists of 9.25 courses 
              in the Department of Psychology with three courses from other departments. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="body">The requirements fall into five categories: 
              foundational courses in the major, content core course, capstone

              requirements for the major. </span> </p>

              This course examines the basic principles and methods of psychological 
              science from an evolutionary and cultural perspective. Students 
              use critical thinking skills to examine fascinating topics: dreaming, 
              cultural influences, identity, learning, thinking and the biology 
              of behavior. Applying basic research methods, students act as skeptical 
              scientists. This course applies to almost any career choice in today's

              Human beings spend one-third of their lives asleep, yet most people 
              know little about this aspect of their lives. This course explores 
              sleep, sleep disorders and dreaming, examining questions such as: 
              Why do we sleep and dream? What are the effects of sleep deprivation? 
              What is known about sleeptalking, sleepwalking and disorders of 
              sleep like insomnia and narcolepsy? Is there any meaning to dreams?
