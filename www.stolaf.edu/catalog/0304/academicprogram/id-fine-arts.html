        <p class="faculty"><b>Director, 2002-03:</b> Susan Bauer (Interdisciplinary 
          Fine Arts), movement analysis, dance </p>

        <p class="programdescription">The fine arts major is designed for the 
          student who wants a well-rounded program in the arts. One of the distinctive 
          features of this interdisciplinary major is the integration of the disciplines 
          of art, dance, theater and music in a way that facilitates a dialogue 
          and collaboration among the art forms. This dialogue is enhanced by 
          creating a balance between learning about all four art forms, grounding 
          oneself in one or two of the art forms and broadening the dialogue to 
          include other disciplines. The interdisciplinary work prepares students 
          to develop an aesthetic perspective, to form criteria for arts evaluation 
          and to reflect critically on the role of the arts in their personal 
          lives, in society and in other cultures. This approach informs a wide 
          range of career options, especially for those interested in working 
          professionally as artists, administrators, teachers, writers or therapists. 
          Students are encouraged to engage in some co-curricular arts organization, 
          volunteer work in the arts, internship or special exhibit/performance 
          event and also to consider off-campus study programs such as HECUA City 
          Arts, Twin Cities; ACM Urban Arts, Chicago, ACM Arts in London and Florence.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR</p>
        <p> <span class="body">Students arrange the major by developing individualized 
          contracts tailored to their particular interests and areas of emphasis. 
          These contracts developed with the faculty of the Interdisciplinary 
          Fine Arts program should include courses that represent a complete, 
          coherent program of study consistent with the goals of the individual 
          student. Contracts should include evidence of theoretical and experiential 
          components of four art forms and grounding in one or more of the art 
          forms. Contracts should be developed no later than the end of the sophomore 
          year but may be altered by mutual consent at any time after their approval. 
          The student and the interdisciplinary fine arts faculty will periodically 
          review contracts. </span></p>
        <p class="body">A contract includes the three interdisciplinary core courses: 
          174, 274 and 374. Each major must select an area of emphasis from the 
          four fine arts disciplines: art, dance, music and theater. Interdisciplinary 
          fine arts majors must complete four courses in the area of emphasis 
          (see Four-Course Area of Emphasis Recommendations below). They also 
          must complete two courses from a secondary fine arts area (see Two-Course 
          Recommendations below). The student must take 1.5 credits from the final 
          two fine arts disciplines (see One and One Half-Course Recommendations 
          below). Students must complete an integrative folder with the assistance 
          of the Center for Experiential Learning. The integrative folder consists 
          of personal goal statements, portfolio of documented art or performance 
          projects and papers and reflections on interests, abilities and values. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">General Education requirements and electives are selected 
          to broaden and yet complement the student's particular interests. 
          In addition to course work, each interdisciplinary fine arts major should 
          engage in some co-curricular arts organization, volunteer work in the 
          arts, internship, independent study/research or special exhibit/performance 
          event. </p>
        <p class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>
        <p class="body"> Students may arrange, as part of their contract, courses 
          in an off-campus study program -- Interims: Theater in London, 
          Manhattan Interim in New York City and Italian Art in Context. Semester/Year 
          Long Programs: HECUA City Arts program in the Twin Cities; ACM Urban 
          Arts program in Chicago; ACM Arts in London and Florence; St. Olaf College's

          a project and apply for departmental distinction with approval of the

          of emphasis must agree to the project. The proposal and project must 
          be submitted and approved by October 1 of the senior year. One of the 
          team members of the Interdisciplinary Fine Arts Program will serve as 
          project advisor. </span></p>
        <p class="body">Senior majors wishing distinction in the major are required 
          to do a special project that demonstrates learning in their area of 
          emphasis and the ability to integrate the four art forms. Projects are 
          to follow one of the following tracks: (1) The student presents or exhibits 
          original works. A written paper of process and reflection is to accompany 
          the event. (2) The student performs established work. A written paper 
          of process and reflection is to accompany the event. (3) The student 
          writes a major paper. </p>

          fine arts team and a faculty member of the major's area of emphasis 
          department. The granting of departmental distinction is based on the 
          special project and the student's overall work within the interdisciplinary 
          major and the student's area of emphasis. </p>
