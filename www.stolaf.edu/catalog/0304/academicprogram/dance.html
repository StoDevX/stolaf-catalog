Since time began, dance has threaded               itself through the fabric of personal, social, cultural and religious               traditions. It excites, invigorates and entices us, echoing our               life experiences. Dance reflects our human desire to shape feelings,               ideas and images with an artistic sensibility.</p>            <p class="programdescription"> Creating dance opens up new connections               within ourselves, with others and with entire communities. At St.               Olaf we lace together a dance experience which emphasizes the American               modern dance tradition in its technical training, while encouraging               study and performance of styles and dances from world cultures.               Performance opportunities range from mainstage productions to informal               showings, from chapel services to off campus events.</p>            <p class="programdescription"> In combining studio and theory work,               the dance major prepares students for a variety of career possibilities.               Recent graduates have performed with professional companies or as               free-lance artists. Others have pursued post-graduate study in dance               therapy or the somatic disciplines. The emerging field of dance               medicine will beckon many in the future, as will careers in arts/dance               administration, dance in the church or teaching in public schools,               private studios or community service agencies.</p>            <p class="programdescription"> St. Olaf is a charter member and an               accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools               of Dance.</p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>            <p class="body">Dance 101, 124, 231, 232, 245, 246, and 399 are the               required core courses. In addition, students select the equivalent               of 1.5 courses in technique in consultation with dance faculty.               Each student also designs an individualized area of specialty related               to a core course and consisting of at least two additional courses               selected from within and/or outside the department. A senior project               completes the area of specialty. Sample specialties include performance-choreography,               body-mind studies and history and ethnology.</p>            <p class="body"> Majors are expected to participate in one of the               dance companies (Companydance or Veselica).

Those whose projects are considered by the department               to represent the highest standards of independent artistic and scholarly               achievement, consonant with the student's training, will be considered               for distinction. This project needs to be an independent, outside               project and cannot be an assignment for another class. Students               may not apply for distinction with the same project in two departments.               In making their decision, dance faculty also will consider the student's               overall achievements in dance</span>.
