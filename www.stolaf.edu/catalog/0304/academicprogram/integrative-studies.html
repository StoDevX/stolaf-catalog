The college has a long-standing commitment               to integrative studies, evident in its many successful interdisciplinary               majors and concentrations, in the 30-year history of the Paracollege               and in our faculty's ability to combine diverse approaches to course               subjects. The CIS's principal activity is to support students pursuing               individual, integrative majors, but it also offers a small curriculum               of seminars and colloquia exemplifying and encouraging integrative               learning and identifies and nurtures existing opportunities for               integrative learning on and off campus. In all these activities,               the CIS's goal is to enhance the coherence of students' academic               careers by encouraging them to make meaningful connections among               the many parts of their educational experience and by helping them               build bridges between the college and other communities. </p>            <p class="goldhead">The Individual Major </p>            <p class="body">The CIS certifies student-designed, integrative majors.               A student may propose any sequence of courses, seminars, independent               studies or experiential learning as the means of pursuing an individual               major. Among other things, the student's proposal must include (1)               a description of the proposed subject matter; (2) a list of 10 or               more proposed courses and other learning experiences and an explanation               of how each contributes to the major; (3) an initial proposal for               a two-semester senior integrative project; and (4) a summary of               the student's preparation to carry out the proposed major. The proposal               must have the support of a faculty academic adviser. The coherence,               depth and feasibility of each proposal is evaluated by a faculty               review committee convened by the CIS. If the proposal is approved,               the student may pursue the individual major with the support and               encouragement of the center. When the student's work is complete               it is presented to a faculty certification committee for review.               Proposals for individual majors may be submitted any time during               the sophomore year and at the beginning of the junior year. Illustrative               examples of recent approved individual majors include: Linguistics               Studies; Language and Meaning; Photojournalism; Models of the Environment;               Conflict and Resolution; Mathematical Foundations of Art; Ethics               in Practice; Human Performance and Wellness; Narrative and Religious               Identity.</p>            <p class="body"> To help students with individual majors to build               meaningful connections among the various parts of their undergraduate               careers and to demonstrate the coherence of their major work, each               maintains a web portfolio. A web portfolio presents and preserves               important achievements. It is maintained in an electronic hyper               medium (like the World Wide Web) that allows students to make explicit               links among the parts of their work, to the work of other students               or to other sites of public discussion. The web portfolio is presented               to the faculty certification committee as part of the work of the               major. </p>            <p class="body">For specific requirements for the individual major               or for information about other activities of the Center for Integrative               Studies, please contact the director or program coordinator.</p>            <p class="goldhead"> COURSES</p>            <p class="goldsubhead">INTEGRATIVE SEMINARS </p>            <p class="body">Faculty in the CIS offer integrative seminars on selected               topics, open to students in the sophomore year or later.

Students               will study and analyze examples of these patterns occurring in the               architecture of buildings and monuments found in the Islamic world.               Application of the acquired geometry and Islamic culture by creating               new original patterns and defending them as appropriate representations               of Islamic decoration.

What               art should be publicly funded and who determines this? How does               corporate or other sponsorship affect the production of art?

Field and laboratory investigations, along with accounts               of scientific discoveries, introduce the nature of scientific inquiry               as a way of understanding natural phenomena. Concurrently, we explore               traditional Christian understandings of how God is related to the               natural world, both normatively and historically. Do methods and               results in biology tend to recommend certain ways of speaking about               the relationships between God, humans and nature? Juxtaposing scientific               and theological questions, we explore how findings in natural science               influence theological doctrine or personal piety and how religious               convictions influence scientific inquiry and our understanding of               nature.

Colloquia allow students to examine               a broad, interdisciplinary topic or question using the tools and               knowledge of their majors. Each new theme is connected to lectures,               performances and other campus events, which provide starting points               for discussion. </p>            <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="is250"></a>250 Thematic               Colloquium (.50) </span><br>              Fall 2002 Topic: &quot;Authority and Expertise&quot;<br>              Spring 2003 Topic: To be announced </p>            <p class="body"><span class="coursename">Integrative Senior Project</span>               <br>              Students with individual majors register for their senior integrative               projects in each semester of the senior year. The first semester,               generally used for research and other preparation in consultation               with the student's adviser, receives a P/N evaluation; the second               semester, and final presentation of the project to the faculty certification               committee, receives a grade.

These               are courses in different departments, offered in the same semester,               whose syllabuses intersect at some shared theme or issue. Students               who register for a pair of linked courses benefit from each course               as a self-contained departmental offering, but also from the integration               of cross-disciplinary approaches afforded by the course linkage.               Linked courses and their thematic connections are listed in the               Class and Lab Schedule. </p>            <p><span class="goldhead">New Courses<br>              </span><span class="change-red"><span class="coursename"> 207 You               Bet Your Life: Rational Risk Assessment in the U.S.</span></span><span class="goldhead"><br>              </span><span class="change-red">Life is a risky proposition. How               do we determine if an activity or choice exceeds our sense of reasonable               risk? How does an understanding of risk, or lack thereof, translate               into political policies? Rational risk assessment relies on the               application of scientific principles and methodology. Students will               explore how biology and chemistry play prominent, interdependent               roles in understanding the risks associated with daily life. Students               will study and apply the principles of science-based assessment               and compare/contrast the outcomes to the portrayal of risk in the               popular press.
