These reflective teachers are able to               recognize dilemmas and make rational choices; assess the intended               and unintended consequences of their choices using practical, pedagogical               and ethical criteria; and accept responsibility for those choices.               Teacher candidates also acquire leadership skills in order to contribute               to the profession and society. St. Olaf's mission is to prepare               its students to be &quot;seekers of truth, leading lives of unselfish               service to others.&quot; The faculty members in the Education Department               share in this mission by graduating teachers who embrace this ideal.               </span></p>            <p class="programdescription">Nearly 15 percent of St. Olaf graduates               qualify for Minnesota teaching licenses each year. Most choose employment               as educators in K-12 (kindergarten through grade 12) classrooms               in the U.S. or abroad. Many also attend graduate school in special               education, counseling or related human services fields.</p>            <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF ST. OLAF'S TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM</p>            <p> <span class="body">St. Olaf is approved by the Minnesota Board               of Teaching (BOT) to recommend its graduates for teaching licensure               in Minnesota, and it is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation               of Teacher Education (NCATE). Licensure requirements vary from state               to state, and students seeking licensure in other states should               contact the teacher licensure agency in those states. To be eligible               for a teaching license through St. Olaf, students must meet the               requirements of their teaching &quot;content area&quot; (mathematics,               social studies, etc.), complete all B.A. or B.M. requirements (which               includes a graduation major) and complete all required education               courses and experiences. (See requirements below.)</span></p>            <p class="body"> The Higher Education Act, Title II, Section 207,               requires all institutions that prepare teachers to report pass rates               on state licensing tests. In Minnesota, teacher candidates were               required to pass the Pre-Professional Skills tests in reading, writing               and mathematics. 100 percent of the 77 students who completed the               St. Olaf Teacher Education Program in 2000-01 passed all the tests               required by the state of Minnesota. Beginning in 2001-02, Minnesota               requires additional tests in pedagogy and content area.</p>            <p class="body"> Note: Because of periodic changes in licensure requirements,               check with the Education Department regarding your program. </p>            <p class="body">St. Olaf offers these preparatory experiences in education:             </p>            <ol>              <li class="body">Secondary/middle school teaching (grades 5-12)                 in the following academic areas: communication arts and literature                 (English, communications); mathematics; science (biology, chemistry,                 physics); social studies (economics, history, geography, political                 science, psychology, sociology/anthropology)</li>              <li class="body"> Kindergarten-12 level in the following academic                 areas: dance and theater; world languages (French, German, Latin,                 Spanish); visual art; music (vocal/classroom, instrumental/classroom)</li>              <li class="body"> <span class="change-strikethrough">Elementary                 level (grades K-6): available for the Classes of 2004-06 through                 a post-baccalaureate program.
