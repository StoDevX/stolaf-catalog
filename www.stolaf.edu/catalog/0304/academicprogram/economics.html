Topics of special interest include rational decision making,               market mechanics, government regulation, taxation and expenditure,               employment, management, productivity, monetary control, environmental               quality and expanding global trade. </p>            <p class="body">The economics curriculum at St. Olaf includes theory,               applications, institutional studies and quantitative analysis. Where               appropriate, economics courses also pursue historical and ethical               concerns. </p>            <p class="body">The department offers areas of emphasis for its majors               who desire more focused study in finance, management, international               economics and policy analysis. The department also supports several               programs available to students regardless of major: an interdisciplinary               concentration in management studies, the programs of the Finstad               Office for Entrepreneurial Studies and international study and internship               opportunities. </p>            <p class="body">The economics major serves as excellent preparation               for careers in a wide variety of fields, including banking, accounting,               consulting, health administration, finance, business management,               teaching and international affairs. The major also provides a solid               foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in economics,               business, public policy and law. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS OF THE MAJOR </p>            <p class="body">Economics at St. Olaf is a contract major. Students               wishing to contract for the major must meet with a department faculty               member to design their major curriculum. Normally, students will               contract for the major before the beginning of their junior year.               Contracts may be amended at any time, subject to consultation with               and approval by a member of the department. </p>            <p class="body">Majors in economics must meet the following minimum               requirements: two courses in mathematics background, one of Mathematics               119, 120, 122, or equivalent, and one of Mathematics 126, 128, 214,               220, 222, or Economics 233; Economics 261 and 262; Statistics 263,               or Mathematics 312 plus Economics 385; and at least four courses               in economic analysis. The economics major requires four courses               in economic analysis with a minimum of one at Level II and two at               Level III unless the student completes an Area of Emphasis. Majors               who also complete an Area of Emphasis within the department must               complete three <span class="change-red">additional</span> courses               in economic analysis, at least one of which must be at Level III.             </p>            <p class="body">In the course of their studies, economics majors should               also gain working knowledge of a statistical computing package,               a text processor and an electronic spreadsheet. </p>            <p class="body">Students considering graduate work in economics are               advised to take additional courses in economic analysis (including               Economics 385) and mathematics (Mathematics 126 or 128, 220, 226               or 228, and 244). </p>            <p class="goldhead">DISTINCTION</p>            <p class="body"> Information about the criteria considered in conferring               distinction is available in the Economics Department and on the               department web page. </p>            <p class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</p>            <p class="goldsubhead"> Areas of Emphasis</p>            <p> <span class="body">Areas of emphasis provide the opportunity for               economics majors to pursue a more structured program of study beyond               the normal major requirements. The department offers two management               studies areas of emphasis and two economics areas of emphasis. Contracts               for each area of emphasis must be individually negotiated with the               appropriate director before the end of the student's junior year.               Students may be certified in one management studies and one economics               area of emphasis. </span></p>            <p class="body">Management studies areas of emphasis include finance               and management. Each requires five management studies courses including               a Level III Management Studies course that also satisfies one of               the requirements for the economics major. A grade of C or better               must be earned in each of the five courses. </p>            <p class="body">The finance area of emphasis requires Management Studies               225, either Management Studies 237 or 259, Management Studies 281,               plus two approved electives, at least one at Level III.
