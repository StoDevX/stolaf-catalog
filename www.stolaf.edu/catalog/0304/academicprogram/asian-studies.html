Beginning with a close reading               of Buddhist texts in translation, students study how Buddhist images               and architecture derive from textual sources &#8212; and often move               beyond them. The course considers the interrelatedness of text and               image in Buddhist practice. Attention is also paid to Western notions               of Buddhism and the development of Buddhist art studies in the West.               GE: ALS-A, MCS-G.</span><br>            </p>            <p class="goldhead">no longer offered</p>            <p class="coursename"><span class="change-red">151 Chinese Women Writers               (In English Translation)</span></p>            <p class="goldsubhead">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="goldsubhead">&nbsp;</p>            <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
