Wilson, theology </p>            <p class="programdescription">The study of religion is an integral               part of the liberal arts curriculum because religion has always               been a major influence on the development of human societies. In               order to make sense of past cultural achievements, it is important               to recognize the influence of religious symbols, beliefs, rituals,               scriptural texts and traditions. To participate meaningfully in               contemporary culture, it is equally important to evaluate the merits               of various theological beliefs and religious values. </p>            <p class="programdescription">All St. Olaf students take courses that               orient them in a general way to the study of religion and acquaint               them with the principal elements of the Christian tradition. The               religion department also makes available a range of courses about               Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism in order to prepare students               to live in our religiously diverse world. </p>            <p class="programdescription">Since the study of religion involves               the use of a variety of methodologies and intersects with many other               fields of study, students often find that a major in religion helps               them integrate their work in other disciplines and develop a focus               for their whole liberal arts education. Many students also choose               to major in religion as a preparation for seminary or graduate work               in religion. </p>            <p class="goldhead">GENERAL EDUCATION CREDIT</p>            <p class="body"> Religion courses fulfill a variety of General Education               requirements. The department offers several options to complete               the Biblical Studies, Theological Studies and Ethical Issues requirements.               Additional courses count as Historical Studies in Western Culture,               Multicultural Studies and Literary Studies. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>            <p class="body">The religion major consists of eight courses and requires               both broad exposure to major approaches to studying religion and               concentrated study in some aspect of religion. The requirements               are organized in four parts:</p>            <ol>              <li class="body"> General Education courses in religion: Religion                 121 [BTS-B] and a course in theological studies [BTS-T].</li>              <li class="body"> Study of at least two religious traditions using                 three different academic approaches: a) sacred texts, b) religion                 in history and culture and c) religious thought.</li>              <li class="body"> Intensive studies in religion: At least two Level                 III courses, at least one of which must be a seminar.</li>              <li class="body"> Elective courses. </li>            </ol>            <p class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION</p>            <p class="body"> Religion majors may graduate with distinction if               their grade point average is 3.5 in religion and 3.0 overall, and               they submit a research project that meets the approval of a departmental               review committee.

Students study the Biblical storyline, major Biblical texts               and their interaction with (e.g.) theology, religious practice,               ethics and social values, while considering methods and fields in               the study of religion in a liberal arts setting.
