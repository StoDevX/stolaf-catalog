The practice               of mathematics combines the aesthetic appeal of creating patterns               of ideas with the utilitarian appeal of applications of these same               ideas. Known as the language of physical science, mathematics is               also used increasingly to model phenomena in the biological and               social sciences. As technology becomes more pervasive, mathematical               literacy is an indispensable skill in today's society. A knowledge               of mathematics has become the key to the fastest growing careers.             </p>            <p class="programdescription">Mathematics at St. Olaf is interesting,               exciting, accessible and an appropriate area of study for all students.               Each year, approximately seven to 10 percent of graduating seniors               have mathematics majors. The department offers courses in several               mathematical sciences: pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics,               computer science, operations research and mathematics education.             </p>            <p class="programdescription">In addition, <span class="change-red">a</span>               <span class="change-strikethrough">special</span> concentration               in <span class="change-strikethrough">computer science and</span>               statistics may be earned in conjunction with any major. <span class="change-red">Beginning               in 2003-04, a major in computer science is available.</span> For               further information <span class="change-strikethrough">on these               concentrations,</span> consult the Index. </p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>            <p class="body">Students arrange a major in mathematics by developing               individualized contracts tailored to their particular interests.               These contracts should include courses that represent a complete,               coherent program of study consistent with the goals of the individual               student. <span class="change-red">The courses that make up an individual&#8217;s               contract are determined after consultation with a mathematics faculty               member and approval by the chair.</span></p>            <p class="body">A contract normally includes two semesters of elementary               calculus, linear algebra and seven or more intermediate or advanced               mathematics courses, including 244, 252, at least one applied course               (266, 312, 316, 330, 384, <span class="change-red">applied</span>               seminar) and at least one course core course (340, 344, 348, 352,               356, 364, 370, or <span class="change-red">analytic</span> seminar).               <span class="change-red">In some cases, other courses offered by               the department will satisfy either the applied or core requirement.</span></p>            <p class="body">Courses in other departments and programs that make               extensive use of mathematical techniques may be allowed as substitutes               for mathematics courses.

Their               contracts must include Mathematics 232, 244, 252, 262, 356, a course               in statistics, and Education 350 in order to meet the State of Minnesota               licensure requirements. Students wishing a teaching minor should               also submit a contract. These should emphasize breadth and will               normally include the equivalent of six courses, in addition to Education               350. </p>            <p class="goldhead"> COURSES </p>            <p class="body"><span class="coursename"><a name="math109"></a>109               Calculus with Algebra I </span><br>              The first in a two-course sequence that integrates precalculus and               first-semester calculus topics, this course seeks command of the               words, graphs and symbols that are the world's basic vocabulary               for quantifying and communicating astronomical, chemical, meteorological,               economic, biological and many other rates of change.
