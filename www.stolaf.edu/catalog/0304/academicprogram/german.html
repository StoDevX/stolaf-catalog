            <p class="programdescription">Studying the German language allows 
              students to explore the interwoven cultural traditions of three 
              countries located in the heart of Europe: Germany, a nation for 
              just over a century but with origins that reach back to the Middle 
              Ages, and the two smaller countries of Austria and Switzerland, 
              each of which has played a significant role in the cultural and 
              political development of Europe. At a time when Germany is playing 
              an increasingly important political and economic role in the new 
              Europe and the integration of East and West, the German language 
              has been gaining pivotal significance as a medium of international 
              negotiation. St. Olaf German graduates are proof that knowledge 
              of German is a definite enhancement for any career.</p>
            <p class="programdescription">In the cultural realm, Germany, Austria 
              and Switzerland have produced some of Europe&#8217;s greatest writers, 
              natural and social scientists, artists, musicians, theologians and 
              philosophers, many of whom are encountered in German course offerings. 
              A major goal of the German Department is to provide courses and 
              programs across disciplines and national boundaries. </p>
            <p><span class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </span><br>
              Majoring in German allows students to deepen their understanding 
              of German culture and to develop their communication skills in both 
              the written and spoken language.</p>
            <p>Courses in the German major serve students who wish to pursue careers 
              in business, education, the sciences or foreign service while also 
              preparing them for a wide range of programs in German literature 
              and culture studies. Each year, German graduates continue their 
              study at German universities with grants from the Fulbright Commission 
              or the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). German majors are 
              strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of the study 
              or internship opportunities in Germany (see below), during either 
              an Interim, summer, semester or full-year program.</p>
            <p>In courses for the major, students gain understanding of German 
              literature, civilization and contemporary culture as they develop 
              analytical and communication skills in the language. All courses 
              for the German major are taught in German.</p>
            <p>Level II courses beyond the language requirement are divided into 
              two sequences. In 250-level courses, students develop their language 
              skills while learning to do close textual analysis. In 270-level 
              courses, students explore the German-speaking world while continuing 
              to refine their critical and language skills. </p>
            <p>Level III courses build upon students&#8217; interpretive skills 
              and their knowledge of the German-speaking world. Students examine 
              in depth a particular genre or topic through the analysis and interpretation 
              of representative works. </p>
            <p>Students need not be German majors to take Level II and III courses 
              or to study abroad. Most students begin their study of German in 
              the 231&#8211;232 sequence. They complete this sequence and take 
              at least one course on campus at the 250-level or above before spending 
              a semester or a year studying in Germany. Courses taken in Germany 
              may satisfy General Education requirements as well as requirements 
              for the German major. Students who spend a semester in Germany may 
              bring back two courses toward the German major; students who spend 
              a full year may bring back three courses. Students must complete 
              at least one of the 300-level courses required for the major on 
              campus.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS/MINOR</p>
            <p><span class="goldsubhead">Graduation Major</span><br>
              A student must take eight courses in German above 232, including 
              two 250-level courses, two 270-level courses (one of which must 
              be taken on campus), two 370-level courses (one of which must be 
              taken on campus) and two other courses of the student&#8217;s choice. 
              An internship taken abroad may count as one of the two courses a 
              student may bring back from a semester&#8217;s study in Germany 
              or of the three courses a student may bring back from a year&#8217;s 
              study in Germany. Independent study or research may not be counted 
              in lieu of any of the courses referred to above.</p>
            <p><span class="goldsubhead">Teaching Major</span><br>
              A student must take eight courses in German above 232, including 
              an intensive speaking course (233 or 250) or a semester/year of 
              study in Germany, three 250-level courses, two 270-level courses 
              and two 370-level courses, plus Education 353 and other courses 
              required for certification.</p>
            <p><span class="goldsubhead">Teaching Minor</span><br>
              A student must take four courses in German above 232, including 
              an intensive speaking course (233 or 250) or a semester/year of 
              study in Germany, two 250-level courses, one 270- or 370-level course, 
              plus Education 353 and other courses required for certification.</p>

              The German Department offers January Interims in Germany and Vienna; 
              it also sponsors semester- or year-long programs for more advanced 
              students at three German universities: Konstanz, Paderborn and Flensburg.
