It produces               a season of plays whose focus is the liberal arts curriculum rather               than a typical theater company's season of plays. All classes focus               on the making of dramatic art. Classes in history and theory, no               less than those in acting, directing and design, approach the problems               and difficulties of making production their central issue. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The activities and skills necessary               for learning about and making theater are well suited to learning               about and contributing to lives of worth and service. The basic               theater activity is making things: play scripts, sets, costumes,               characters and the complete works of which these are a part. The               theater skills are leading, following, reading, writing, talking,               drawing, building, acting, performing and making arrangements. We               place these skills in the service of our conception of theater as               a way of knowing. Our courses, along with the rest of the college               curriculum, develop an appreciation of the need for moral choice,               an imagination that constructs and examines alternatives and an               understanding of creativity as a reality in the world and an agency               of community and change. We think of the program as a kind of laboratory               for a serious and productive life. This is what we mean when we               call the study of theater at St. Olaf a liberal arts major.</p>            <p class="programdescription"> In contemporary culture, theater and               the entertainment industry overlap, with the result that public               approbation and artistic success have become difficult to separate.               Our program emphasizes process as well as public performance so               that students can, without the confusing interference of popular               acclaim or criticism, learn to judge their own work according to               principles derived from the art itself. And as part of the fine               arts at St. Olaf, we also emphasize collaboration and the interdisciplinary               nature of theater. </p>            <p class="programdescription">The St. Olaf College Theatre Department               is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre.               General Education credit courses in the Theatre Department meet               selected GE requirements. See notations within each course description.</p>            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE THEATRE MAJOR</p>            <p class="body"> The major requires a minimum of nine courses, of               which two must be from Level I, two from Level II and three from               Level III, plus four practicum quarter credits. All majors must               register with the department chair as soon as they declare the major.               Course Requirements: Theatre 110, 130 or 131, 150 or 250, 232, 270,               271, 352, 379 plus one additional course selected from: relevant               internships, independent study/research and interims, 100, 200,               210, 252, 130 or 131, 150 or 250, 230, 338, Dance 332.
