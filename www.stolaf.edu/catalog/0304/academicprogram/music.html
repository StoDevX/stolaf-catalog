            <p> <span class="programdescription">Inspired by the conviction that 
              music is a divine gift, the St. Olaf College Music Department devotes 
              itself to the cultivation of this gift in the lives of its students 
              and in the broader community. We dedicate ourselves to creating 
              an educational experience that unites the artistic standards of 
              a professional program with the intellectual rigors and academic 
              breadth of the liberal arts in an environment of free, creative 
              and critical inquiry. Through music we affirm the college's mission 
              to foster the development of the whole person in mind, body and 
              spirit.</span></p>
            <p class="programdescription"> The Music Department offers extensive 
              opportunities to explore, practice and celebrate the musician's 
              art with an ongoing commitment to a distinctive ensemble program, 
              excellent individualized instruction and a comprehensive undergraduate 
              music curriculum. We honor St. Olaf's rich heritage spanning more 
              than a century of international artistry and scholarship and will 
              continue to cultivate a spirit of exploration and innovation, seeking 
              and celebrating the transcendent and transforming power of music.

            <p class="body">The Music Department offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor 
              of Music degrees, which are accredited by the National Association 
              of Schools of Music: </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music</p>
            <p class="body"> This is a liberal arts degree, with approximately 
              one-third of the course work in music. It is available in general 
              music studies or with a teaching credential or with an emphasis 
              in history-literature, theory-composition<span class="change-strikethrough"> or collaborative keyboard 
              performance</span>. The breadth of study of a liberal arts degree offers 
              students a wide range of career options in music and related fields. 
              Examples include performance, broadcasting, multimedia, arts administration, 
              advertising, education, arts journalism, music librarianship or 
              music therapy. Graduate study is also an option. </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Bachelor of Music</p>
            <p class="body"> This is a professional music degree with approximately 
              two-thirds of the course work in music. Students are admitted to 
              the program by audition, either as part of their application process 
              or after beginning their studies at St. Olaf. </p>
            <p class="body"><b>1. Bachelor of Music in Performance</b></p>
            <p class="body"> Students with this degree often continue with graduate 
              work in preparation for careers in performance or private and college 
              teaching. This degree is also a good base for an advanced degree 
              in such fields as pedagogy and music therapy. Piano and organ performance 
              majors may also pursue an emphasis in collaborative keyboard performance.</p>
