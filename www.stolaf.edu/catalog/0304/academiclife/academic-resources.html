        <p class="programname">Academic Resources</p>
        <p class="programdescription">Together, the St. Olaf Libraries and Information 
          and Instructional Technologies provide a variety of carefully selected 
          resources (ranging from Luther's Grosse Katechismus to the World Wide 
          Web) that seek to mirror the breadth and depth of the undergraduate 
          curriculum. The partnership between the Libraries and Information and 
          Instructional Technologies provides access to regional, national and 
          international networks, databases and other sources of information. 
          A strong system of libraries and computing center laboratories and access 
          to the campus network from residence halls and faculty offices ensure 
          the availability of academic resources to the entire community.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="subhead">St. Olaf's Libraries and Special Collections</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><span class="body">Twenty-five library faculty and staff and more than 
          100 students work to purchase, organize and make available a rich blend 
          of materials and access points. The collections contain over 600,000 
          books and bound periodicals and over 275,000 nonbook items (CDs, videos, 
          sound recordings, software, microform, etc.), housed in three separate 
          libraries: Rolvaag Memorial Library (the "main" library), Halvorson 
          Music Library and Glasoe Science Library. The libraries receive more 
          than 1,700 print periodicals, as well as hundred of electronic publications. 
          The libraries are a partial depository for federal government publications. 
          While the collections provide the basic resources required for undergraduate 
          study as defined by the college curriculum, they have unusual strengths 
          and emphases which reflect unique elements in the college's tradition. 
          Therefore they are especially strong in the fields of religion, Scandinavian 
          literature and history, mathematics and music. St. Olaf is one of the 
          few places where extensive materials can be found for the study of the 
          culture and church life of Norwegian Americans.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> In addition to the St. Olaf collections, the libraries 
          also provide access to materials held across the state, the nation and 
          the world through their home-pages, the on-line catalog system, a variety 
          of CD-ROM and online services and the Internet. Strong consortial relationships 
          ensure the availability of supplemental materials that enrich undergraduate 
          study and research.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> The St. Olaf Libraries are distinguished by an 
          instruction program which teaches students research methodologies and 
          evaluation techniques applicable to a variety of disciplines. The instruction 
          is used immediately as students work on assignments dealing with a world 
          of rapidly proliferating information and delivery systems and will also 
          provide a foundation for lifelong learning after they leave the college. 
          Librarians work with specific assignments in classes and provide research 
          assistance at the reference desks -- Rolvaag (over 60 hours per week) 
          and the science and music libraries as posted. The libraries are open 
          95 hours per week when class is in session -- with extended hours late 
          in the semester and during exams. </span></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Kierkegaard Library: </b> <br>
          The Howard and Edna Hong Kierkegaard Library, located within the Rolvaag 
          Library Building, is one of the major research libraries in the world 
          for the study of the thought of the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard. 
          The library was presented to St. Olaf College in 1976 by the Hongs, 
          St. Olaf alumni and internationally noted Kierkegaard scholars and translators. 
          Howard Hong is a professor emeritus of philosophy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"><b> College Archives: </b><br>
          Located in the Rolvaag Library Building, the Shaw-Olson Center for College 
          History contains official records and publications, private papers, 
          photographs, books, periodicals, audio and visual recordings and museum 
          artifacts that record and illustrate the history and life of the college. 
          These materials provide historical information about the Board of Regents, 
          the faculty, the student body, alumni, academic departments, the curriculum, 
          administrative offices, campus services, college organizations and campus 
          activities. The mission of the archives is 1) to preserve materials 
          that reflect the college's identity; 2) to make these materials available 
          to scholars, students, alumni and other interested researchers; and 
          3) to promote attention to the college through public history projects. 
          The archives web page includes a search engine for the completed on-line 
          index of the <i>Manitou Messenger,</i> the student newspaper. The archives 
          also provides work study opportunities for some students and a limited 
          number of internships for majors in appropriate departments and programs.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"><b> The Norwegian-American Historical Association: 
          </b><br>
          Housed in the Rolvaag Library Building, the Norwegian-American Historical 
          Association (NAHA) has been sheltered by St. Olaf since its founding 
          in 1925. With an international membership of nearly 2,000, NAHA has 
          two goals: to publish scholarly books on Norwegian-American history 
          (90 books have been published so far) and to be a national center for 
          research in Norwegian-American history by collecting and maintaining 
          printed and manuscript materials produced by Norwegian-Americans or 
          concerning their history. Printed materials are incorporated in the 
          college library collection and other materials (such as diaries, journals, 
          newspapers, periodicals and records of organizations) in a separate 
          archive. The oldest, out of print publications are available on the 
          NAHA website at: <i>www.naha.stolaf.edu</i>. Both students and the public 
          are invited to use this center for research in Norwegian migration.

        <p><span class="body"> Information and Instructional Technologies (IIT) 
          provides computers, software, A/V technologies and support services 
          to the entire St. Olaf community. Nearly 250 public Macintoshes and 
          PC-compatibles connect to a campus network that provides free access 
          to e-mail, software servers, printing resources and the Internet.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Public labs are located in all the academic buildings 
          and residence halls and provide equal access to equipment and software 
          for all students, whether or not they are enrolled in a course requiring 
          the use of the computer. In addition to the public facilities, 19 departments 
          share or have their own specialized computing labs. This brings the 
          total number of computers available for student use to more than 640. 
          </span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Computing use is not limited to out-of-class assignments 
          as 91 percent of the St. Olaf faculty rely on some form of computing 
          technology in their teaching, e-mail notifications or discussions and 
          web assignments being the most popular. The college is working to ensure 
          that classrooms are equipped with the appropriate technologies and, 
          at present, 27 classsrooms have a computer-projection system and other 
          related technologies. Additional classroom teachnology installations 
          are added each year.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Over 82 percent of all students have their own 
          computer on campus; most also have their own printer. Students who own 
          a computer can connect to the campus network and the Internet in their 
          own rooms in all of the eleven residence halls. </span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> IIT employs 22 full-time professionals and nearly 
          70 student employees who support the computing needs of the entire campus 
          - students, staff and faculty. A campus Help Desk is staffed nearly 
          66 hours per week during the academic year.</span></p>
