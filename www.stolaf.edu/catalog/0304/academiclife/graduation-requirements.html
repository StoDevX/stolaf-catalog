        <p><b><span class="body">7. Major - 8 or More Full-Credit Courses</span></b></p>
        <p></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Objective:</b>To study a discipline or an interdisciplinary 
          field in depth.<br>
          <b>Requirement:</b> A minimum of eight full-credit courses in a disciplinary 
          or interdisciplinary major.<br>
          <b>Specific requirements</b> for each major are listed in the preface 
          to course offerings in each department and interdisciplinary program. 
          All majors include writing requirements. Many departments/programs require 
          more than the minimum eight courses for a major; they may also require 
          comprehensive examinations or papers.</span></p>
        <p class="goldsubhead"> Comprehensive Graduation Requirements (General 
          Education)</p>
        <p> <span class="body">Some courses in the St. Olaf curriculum count for 
          more than one graduation requirement at the same time. A course taken 
          for Studies in Natural Science may also be the first course in the chemistry 
          major. A course taught in the Department of English may simultaneously 
          satisfy requirements for Literary Studies and Multicultural Studies. 
          Courses with writing usually fulfill more than one requirement. In addition, 
          students may complete requirements with courses taken on international 
          and off-campus programs.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> A typical course of study may have proportions 
          like these:</span></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>General Education:</b> 14-16 courses<br>
          <b>Major:</b> 8-10 courses <br>
          <b>Electives:</b> 10-12 courses<br>
          <b>Total for graduation:</b> 35 course credits </span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Depending upon Advanced Placement examination results, 
          choice of foreign language, prior preparation in languages and mathematics, 
          choice of a major and a second major or teaching certification, the 
          proportions will vary. </span></p>

        <p class="subhead">Foundation Courses</p>
        <p><span class="body"><b>1. First-Year Writing [FYW] - 1 course </b></span></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Objective:</b> To equip students for effective 
          writing in the liberal arts and introduce writing as a means of learning.<br>
          <b>Requirement:</b> Satisfactory completion of General Education 111 
          in the first year of study. Students who initially transfer 15 or more 
          courses to St. Olaf are exempt from this requirement.<br>
          <b>Placement:</b> Students who need to improve their writing skills 
          complete English 110: Critical Skills in Composition, in the first semester 
          of the first year, then complete a General Education 111 in the second 
          semester of the first year. All other students may enroll directly in 
          a General Education 111 section.</span></p>

        <p><b><span class="body">2. Courses with Writing [WRI] - 4 courses</span></b></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Objective:</b> To sustain and improve writing 
          skills.</span></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Requirement:</b> Satisfactory completion of 
          four courses across the curriculum designated as Courses with Writing.</span></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b><span class="body">3. Foreign Language [FOL] - 0-4 courses</span></b></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Objective:</b> To develop non-English language 
          skills to an intermediate level, deepen understanding of language as 
          a human phenomenon and generate insights into a culture other than one's 
          own.</span></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Requirement:</b> Satisfactory completion of 
          the fourth college semester course (numbered 232 or higher) taught in 
          the French, German or Spanish languages; or satisfactory completion 
          of the third college semester course (numbered 231 or higher) taught 
          in the Chinese, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Norwegian or Russian languages.</span></p>
        <p> <span class="body"><b>Placement:</b> The college provides placement 
          examinations for new students. On the basis of examination results and 
          the admissions record, the college assists with initial placement in 
          a first-, second-, third- or fourth-semester course. All students are 
          advised to begin foreign language study in the first semester of the 
          first year and to continue their language study in each subsequent semester 
          until the requirement is completed. In cases where a student's schedule 
          of courses makes that impossible, the student should consult with his 
          or her adviser.</span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Students may also fulfill the foreign language 
          requirement by demonstrating proficiency at the required third- or fourth-semester 
          level either through a St. Olaf proficiency examination or by transfer 
          of college credits in a single foreign language at the appropriate levels 
          as determined by the relevant St. Olaf foreign language department and 
          the registrar. Proficiency reports from persons not known to St. Olaf 
          must be based on documented exposure or training by the student in a 
          foreign language equivalent in length to three or four college semesters 
          or demonstration of a sufficient length of time in a non-English speaking 
          culture to give credence to a proficiency report. As a rule, proficiency 
          reports from persons outside of St. Olaf are not acted upon until the 
          student arranges for a final proficiency exam by persons and methods 
          agreed to by members of the foreign language faculty, the registrar 
          and, if necessary, the dean of the college. Such exams may involve an 
          expense paid by the student. Students fulfilling the foreign language 
          requirement with courses transferred from an American institution should 
          first consult with the registrar. These transferred courses must be 
          in a single language and at the appropriate level. </span></p>
        <p><span class="body"> Alternatives to the foreign language requirement 
          are rarely considered and only if strict adherence to course requirements 
          and class attendance are met. Students experiencing special language 
          difficulty or students for whom English is a second language should 
          consult the registrar or the director of academic advising. See Index.</span></p>
