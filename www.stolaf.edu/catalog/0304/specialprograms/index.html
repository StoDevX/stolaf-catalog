        <p class="programname">Education Put to Work</p>
        <p class="programdescription">The college is proud of its record of &quot;education 
          put to work.&quot; Breadth in liberal arts study combined with depth 
          in an academic major remains the most adaptable and enduring education 
          for students anticipating productive lives in a rapidly changing world.</p>
        <p class="programdescription">A large percentage of St. Olaf graduates 
          continue their education in America's best graduate and professional 
          schools. According to the National Research Council's Survey of Earned 
          Doctorates, St. Olaf ranks sixth among bachelor's degree colleges in 
          the number of graduates who went on to earn doctoral degrees during 
          the period 1991-2000. St. Olaf was first among baccalaureate colleges 
          in mathematics, fourth in chemistry and sixth in life sciences as an 
          undergraduate supplier of Ph.D.s during the same period. (It ranks 11th 
          among all higher education institutions as a source of Ph.D.s in mathematics.)</p>
        <p class="programdescription">Many St. Olaf graduates enter university 
          programs in medicine, law, the fine arts, business and management and 
          government and public policy, as well as research programs in technologies 
          not dreamed of a decade ago. Other graduates embrace the life and mission 
          of the Church, teaching and careers in international service, outreach 
          and travel. </p>
        <p class="programdescription">The college counsels patience, search and 
          reflection in the preparation for future work. Some of the most successful 
          academic programs and majors preparatory for careers are not decided 
          until the end of the sophomore year, and college majors that seem unrelated 
          to specific careers often prove extremely viable. It is noteworthy that 
          many of the country's top business leaders were philosophy or history 
          majors. Today it is not uncommon to see chemistry majors enter law school 
          and English majors (with requisite health science electives) admitted 
          to medical school.</p>
        <p class="body">A number of factors contribute to the success of St. Olaf 
          graduates, including an education that recognizes that as knowledge 
          becomes increasingly less compartmentalized it will be those who have 
          learned how to learn who will have the advantage. </p>
        <p class="body">Through their regular coursework, innovative options like 
          the Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum program (see Index), and 
          the hands-on experience provided by independent study and research options, 
          internships, and programs like the Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial 
          Studies, students explore the interconnectedness of the world today 
          &#151; and prepare for life in the ever-changing world of tomorrow. 
        </p>
        <p class="body">Guiding students in their explorations are the informed 
          and caring men and women of the St. Olaf faculty and staff, who provide 
          continuing support to students in a regular and resourceful program 
          of search and guidance. A number of pre-professional studies programs 
          also help them shape their studies to fit the requirements of America's 
          top professional and graduate schools. </p>
        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</span></p>
        <p class="body"><span class="subhead">The Center for Experiential Learning 
          </span><br>
          The Center for Experiential Learning (CEL) was established in 2000 to 
          fulfill the vision of providing every interested St. Olaf student with 
          experiential learning opportunities that relate to and complement the 
          St. Olaf liberal arts curriculum. Building on the educational strategy 
          that students need to &quot;live their learning&quot; by creating bridges 
          between classroom work and the world by &quot;the Hill,&quot; CEL programs 
          focus on internships and service learning, career development and entrepreneurial 
          studies. Programs are implements through the CEL's Offices for Career 
          Connections, Internships, Servant Leadership and Entrepreneurial Studies 
          with the intent of providing a coordinated, comprehensive, classroom-based 
          experiential learning program that is academically sound, inclusive 
          of all academic disciplines and connected with all sectors of the domestic 
          and global communities. For in-depth information about these programs, 
          visit <a href="/services/cel">http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel</a>.</p>
        <p class="body"><b>Career Connections</b> &#151; The mission of the Office 
          for Career Connections is to assist students in developing, implementing 
          and evaluating career/life plans and to educate faculty and staff regarding 
          issues of career and life planning. The career connections process emphasizes 
          career exploration, experiential learning and reflection through a wide 
          range of assessments, resources, services and programs throughout the 
          campus community. </p>
        <p class="body"><b>Internships</b> &#151; The Office for Internships provides 
          a one-stop service to students seeking experiential learning (outside 
          the classroom) opportunities &#151; a unique learning experience offering 
          students the opportunity to develop and sharpen transferable skills, 
          build a network of employer contacts, assess strengths and test classroom 
          theories in real world settings. The office works to create meaningful 
          learning experiences by facilitating interactions between students, 
          faculty, alumni and organizations.</p>
        <p class="body"><b>Entrepreneurial Studies</b> &#151; The Paul and Anne 
          Finstad Office for Entrepreneurial Studies was established in 1992 with 
          a major gift from the Finstads and other St. Olaf alumni. The office 
          promotes entrepreneurial thinking and action among students, faculty 
          and alumni of the college.</p>
        <p class="body"><b>Servant Leadership</b> &#151; The mission of the Office 
          for Servant Leadership is to support students and faculty as they connect 
          classroom learning with practical, &quot;hands-on&quot; service in a 
          community setting. This connection between classroom and community occurs 
          in such a way that all parties &#151; students, faculty and individuals 
          in the community &#151; benefit from the interaction. The office supports 
          development of value-based leadership skills that go beyond traditional 
          training to an emerging model of leadership that doesn't rely solely 
          on power or position. Servant leadership encourages students, faculty 
          and staff to become agents of change and transformation within the campus 
          community and in the larger society. The goal of servant leadership 
          programs is an engaged campus, one where students and faculty explore 
          vital contemporary issues by involved themselves in service to the community.
