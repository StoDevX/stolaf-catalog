            <p class="faculty"><em>The following roster of pre-professional studies indicates how the liberal arts can fulfill the general as well as the specialized objectives of St. Olaf students. Recommendations are based on the typical pre-professional requirements currently existing in universities and professional schools. </em></p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>Many other occupations beyond those in this roster may be pursued with a liberal arts background, of course. To learn more about them, call or visit the campus contact persons listed in areas that seem similar. </em></p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>Subjects grouped under the headings &ldquo;Strongly Recommended&rdquo; are required by many institutions while those under &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; are important but not necessarily required. Because of their diverse nature, many professions such as business and management, law, and public policy defy course-specific recommendations for undergraduates. For example, as many psychology as economics majors in the United States enter business careers each year through corporate training programs. In those instances, recommendations should be considered suggestive, not directive. Opposite examples are <a href="../academicprogram/nursing.html">nursing</a> and <a href="../academicprogram/social-work.html">social work</a>, which have prescribed curriculums required for licensure examinations. </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">PRE-PROFESSIONAL STUDIES</p>
            <p class="body">Students are encouraged to work closely with faculty, pre-professional advisors, department chairs, and the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/services/cel/">Center for Experiential Learning</a> during and after their time at St. Olaf. </p>

            <p class="body">Students planning to sit for the CPA examination upon graduation should major in economics or mathematics and take elective courses in accounting and finance. Since 2000, new members of the American Institute of CPAs have been required to earn one year of college credit beyond the bachelor&rsquo;s degree.

            <p class="body">Computer science remains at the heart of preparation for careers or graduate study in computer engineering (which focuses on hardware design) and software engineering, since computer science provides a conceptual foundation for computing disciplines. The emphasis on &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; learning techniques, professionalism, and computing ethics and on the development of communication and leadership skills in St. Olaf&rsquo;s computer science major program give a further preparatory boost to future engineers. The following courses are particularly recommended. </p>

A cooperative program exists that enables a student to receive a B.A. degree from St. Olaf and a B.S. degree in engineering from either Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., or the University of Minnesota, in a five-year program.

            <p class="body"><strong>Recommended:</strong> Courses in political science and economics are most directly applicable and are strongly rec-ommended.

Courses in all disciplines can offer unique perspectives on public policy issues and excellent training for a career in public service. </p>
            <p class="body">Students with an interest in an international career (such as the Foreign Service) should, in addition to courses recommended above, pursue advanced foreign language studies. </p>
