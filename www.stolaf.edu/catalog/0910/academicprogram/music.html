        </div>
        <p>To receive departmental distinction, a senior music major must be nominated by a faculty member and confirmed as eligible by a two-thirds vote of the Music Department faculty. Eligibility nominations are based on evidence of sustained academic and musical excellence. Eligible seniors will be notified by October 1.</p>
        <p>Typically, distinction candidates complete a project directly relating to their major, for example:</p>
        <table width="594" border="1">
          <tr>
            <td width="288">BM performance</td>

          <tr>
            <td>BA Music, History-Literature emphasis</td>
            <td>a major research paper</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>BM or BA, Theory-Composition</td>
            <td>a significant composition, publicly performed</td>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All projects must be approved by a faculty advisor and by the music department chair. All projects are evaluated by a committee of three faculty members, selected by the music department chair. Evaluations are shared with the full music faculty, and a two-thirds majority vote determines the candidates who will receive distinction.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead">Music Performance Studies</p>
              <p class="body">Music performance studies provide a direct opportunity to think and speak the language of music. Lessons integrate aspects of music's cultural and historical contexts, its theoretical properties, and the physical and psychological facets of performance. Music performance studies earn ALS-A credit. A full credit (4 x 0.25) of study on a single instrument or voice is required to meet the ALS-A comprehensive graduation requirement.</p>
              <p class="body">Variable credit private lessons  are available in bassoon, clarinet, composition, cornet, euphonium, flute, English  horn, French horn, hardanger fiddle, harp, harpsichord, oboe, organ,  percussion, piano, jazz piano, saxophone, string bass, trombone,  trumpet, tuba, viola, violin, violoncello, and voice. Lessons are catalogued as Level I and Level II Music Performance Studies (MUSPF) courses, and course numbers are referenced in the St. Olaf Class &amp; Lab Schedule.</p>
              <p class="body">Music Performance Studies are offered at three credit levels:</p>
      <blockquote>
                <p class="body">0.25 credit: weekly half-hour lessons, daily minimum one-hour practice expectation<br />
                  0.50 credit: weekly one-hour lessons, daily minimum two-hour practice expectation<br />
                  1.00 credit: weekly one-hour lessons, daily minimum three-hour practice expectation</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="body">Registration for all applied music lessons is processed through the Music Office (CHM 101). Elective private study for non-music majors (0.25 credit) is available on a space-available basis to students demonstrating sufficient skill level gained through prior study.</p>
              <p class="body">All students in the Bachelor of Music program receive a lesson scholarship for principal-instrument/voice study. Beginning in the sophomore year, Bachelor of Arts music majors also receive a lesson scholarship for principal-instrument voice/study.</p>
              <p class="body">For all elective and secondary-instrument/voice performance studies, students are assessed a fee of $395 per 0.25 credit. Fees will be refunded only if a student drops the course by the 6th day classes each semester. No refund is given thereafter.</p>
              <p class="body">Enrollment for lessons in any applied studio entails attendance and performance at studio classes, and attendance at a specified number of music department-approved events.</p>
          <p class="body">To perform solo on any official recital, students must be concurrently enrolled in lessons on the performing instrument/voice.</p>
