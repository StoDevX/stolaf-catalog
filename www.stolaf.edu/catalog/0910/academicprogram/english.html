              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2009-10:</strong> Mark Allister, American literature, environmental literature, American studies;  Mark Bresnan, 20th and 21st-century American literature; Richard C. Buckstead, American literature, Asian literature; Karen Cherewatuk, Anglo Saxon, medieval literature; Jennifer Kwon Dobbs, creative writing; Jenny Dunning, creative writing; Richard DuRocher, Renaissance literature, Milton;  Joan Hepburn, African American literature, drama;  Jan C.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Literature  is one of the most compelling ways in which humans have recorded and  reflected on their lives, imagined different worlds, and communicated  one with another. It offers the pleasures of artistic  expression combined with the rewards of empathy and  insight, knowledge and inspiration. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Drawing on 1500 years of literature from Geoffrey Chaucer and John Milton to Emily Dickinson, Chinua Achebe and Toni Morrison, the English major encourages students to dig deeply and to range widely, crossing borders and exploring diversity both in content (authors, literary genres and historical periods) and in form (critical and creative approaches).</p>
              <p class="programdescription">Students are exposed to a variety of conceptual approaches to literary study. The traditional methodologies of literary history and genre studies remain. But students also learn the cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural methods that are redefining literary canons and strongly influencing scholarship as we move into the 21st century.</p>
              <p class="programdescription">As they discuss and write about what they have read, students develop an informed understanding of the force of literary language and improve their powers of communication, analysis, and persuasion. In the department's creative writing courses, students can nourish their own verbal creativity while working with literary forms from the inside.</p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  English major is easily and frequently combined with other majors, and is compatible with off-campus study. Most courses taken elsewhere can count toward the major as electives.  </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Some English majors may be headed for graduate programs in literature; some plan to teach; some are creative writers. Others may be preparing for careers that reward strong communication skills, in fields such as publishing, law, business, or community service. Within a framework requiring them to experience multiple approaches to literature, students have flexibility in shaping their course of study to their individual interests and aspirations.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> Organized around four Categories (Literary History, Cross-Cultural, Cross-Disciplinary, and Genre), the English major requires ten courses: English 185, three level II courses in specified categories, and six electives, two of which must be from level III. Among the level II courses, one must be in literature before 1800, and one in literature after 1800.</p>

Level III courses (numbered 300 or higher) are primarily for  English majors and ordinarily build upon prior work. All Level III  courses require as a prerequisite English 185 and at least one Level II  course in an area of relevant background as confirmed by the instructor  or the department. </p>

Specific programs  should be planned with the student&rsquo;s academic advisor. At least two  foreign languages should be included, one of which should be French or  German. In recent years, English majors have been accepted for graduate  study in literature (at Berkeley, Chicago, Princeton, Toronto,  Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin) and in writing (at Boston  University, George Mason, Iowa, and New School University). </p>
