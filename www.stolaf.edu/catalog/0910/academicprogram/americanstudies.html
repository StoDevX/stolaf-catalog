              <p class="programdescription"> The American Studies Program offers St. Olaf students the opportunity to construct their own interdisciplinary courses of study themed around American society, culture, and institutions. The core work in the program provides students with the analytic and theoretical tools they need to integrate disciplinary perspectives. Students observe and analyze cultural patterns - ethnic, racial, religious - and gender differences and commonalities to consider the American identity and the impact of our society on the larger world. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The American studies major is structured for both exploration and coherence. The Level I seminar introduces  and integrates different disciplinary questions and concepts in the  study of contemporary culture. The Level II seminar combines different  disciplines to study a single topic or time period. And the Level III  seminar invites students to participate in a substantial  interdisciplinary research project. </p>
            </div>

              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/amstud.htm">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
              <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">In  consultation with an advisor, students construct nine-course majors  which normally include American Studies 100, a 200-level topics course  and a 300-level seminar (when subjects are different, the topics course  and the seminar may be taken more than once) and six designated  disciplinary courses (with at least one course in each of three  departments). Of the nine courses, at least three must be at Level III.  Students in the American Conversations program should consult with the director. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Because  the United States is composed of a multiplicity of peoples, at least  one course dealing with racial and multicultural studies is  recommended. Because American studies is an active interaction with an  ongoing culture, we recommend programs of service and/or internships.  Because American studies is implicitly comparative, we also recommend  the &ldquo;perspective by incongruity&rdquo; of international study. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-status.html#distinct">DISTINCTION</a> </h5>
          <p class="body"> Seniors  majors may apply for distinction in American studies. Candidates must  satisfy minimum GPA requirements (3.50 in the major),  prepare a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  by Oct. 15 of their senior year; the review occurs in April. </p>
