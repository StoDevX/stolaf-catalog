            <h2 class="programname"> Neuroscience</h2>
            <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2009-10: </strong>Gary Muir (Psychology), neuroscience, spatial cognition</span></p>
        <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2009-10:</strong> Kevin Crisp (Biology), neuroethology, neurobiology; Shelly Dickinson (Psychology), behavioral neuroscience, addiction (on leave); Henry Kermott (Biology), zoology, animal behavior;      Bonnie Sherman (Psychology), perception,  neuropsychology (on leave Fall Semester); Howard Thorsheim (Psychology), human cognition, psychophysiology; David Van Wylen (Biology), cardiac physiology,

        <p class="programdescription">Neuroscience is the study of nervous stystems: organized collections of neurons, such as brains, that sense the environment, process and store information and generate physiological and behavioral responses in animals, including humans. An interdisciplinary field, neuroscience integrates diverse academic perspectives (such as biology, psychology, chemistry, computer science and philosophy) and employs numerous levels of inquiry (from the molecular to the cognitive). Modern neuroscience research ranges from basic science questions examining how nerve cells generate signals to clinical research exploring treatments for Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Overview of the Concentration</p>
        <p class="body"> Neuroscience is a multidisciplinary program that provides students access to the field by linking  curricula, faculty, and students in a contract concentration that  requires foundations in at least two natural sciences and stretches to  connect with courses in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. It  provides students with a broad introductory exposure to the field of  neuroscience  by requiring students to integrate material from several disciplines to  answer questions about the brain, behavior, and consciousness. Students  must first consult with the director of the neuroscience concentration  by the end of the sophomore year and develop a contract. The contract  may be altered by mutual consent at any time. </p>
<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/neuro.htm">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE CONCENTRATION</a></h5>
          <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p class="body"> The neuroscience concentration consists of six courses: an introductory neuroscience course (Neuroscience 234), four core elective courses, and a capstone seminar. Neuroscience 234, Introduction to Neuroscience,  provides a foundation and overview of the important and extensive ways  in which biological and psychological processes are involved in the  regulation and maintenance of behavior. The four core elective courses  are selected from appropriate offerings in psychology (one 200-level  course with lab), biology (one 200-level course with lab), any of the departments in the  Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (one 300-level  course with lab), and from neuroscience-related offerings from an area outside  the natural sciences (one course). The final course for the  concentration is a capstone seminar. The prerequisite for this class is  the completion of the other requirements in the neuroscience  concentration. Students are strongly encouraged to take Psychology 238, Biopsychology, as well. </p>
        </div>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate study</h5>
              <p class="body">Graduate programs in neuroscience vary widely in their admission requirements so students intending to attend graduate school in neuroscience are advised to determine the requirements of the specific programs they are considering. In general, however, a number of neuroscience graduate programs recommend chemistry through biochemistry, genetics, and statistics.</p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">COURSES </h5>
          <p class="coursename"><a name="neuroscience-234"></a>234 Introduction to Neuroscience</p>
<p>Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields, with activity ranging from the fundamentals of
behavior to molecular aspects of neuronal function. This course provides a foundation and
overview of the important and extensive ways in which biological and physiological processes are
involved in the regulation and maintenance of behavior. Among the topics students explore are:
fundamental electrophysiology, sensory and motor systems, integration, and learning and memory.
Counts towards the Biology and Psychology majors. Prerequisites: Biology 125, or Chemistry 121
(or 125), or Chemistry/Biology 125, or Physics 130, or Psychology 125. Biology 125 is strongly
recommended. Offered annually in the Fall Semester.</p>
