              <p> <span class="programdescription">Environmental  studies explores the relationships between natural systems, the political issues of power, justice, liberty and equality, as well as ethics, philosophy, art, culture, and literature. The result is an all-important interdisciplinary view of environmental issues and insights into understanding environmental complexity that call one to action. Addressing environmental concerns and investigating questions of environmental significance require a comprehensive and rigorous understanding of the relationship between humans and their environment, including a sense of place. Practitioners achieve this understanding through the intersection of knowledge and expertise from the natural and social sciences, and arts and humanities, as applied to the study of the intellectual and physical connections that define humanity's role in the environment. Ultimately the program strives to contribute to an understanding of biological and physical processes, responsible policy and practice, imaginative thinking, and ethical reflection spanning local and global communities.</span></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</h5>
              <p>Environmental Studies  combines the strengths of disciplinary work in contributing departments with  interdisciplinary studies, giving both broad and focused perspectives on  environmental problems and issues. The program offers a major in environmental  studies with three tracks in which students may choose to focus their work:  natural sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities. In many cases work  in these tracks overlaps with traditional departmental curricula, and many students  choose to complete a second major there. Recognizing the global dimensions of  many environmental problems and the need for learning outside of the classroom,  the program provides a number of opportunities for studies abroad and in the  field.</p>
              <p>All students majoring in  environmental studies take twelve required courses including an introductory course  that emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of environmental questions and  lays the groundwork for the major.&nbsp;  Similarly a capstone senior seminar course challenges students to  integrate and apply what they have learned throughout their studies.&nbsp; Each major must participate in an experience  that applies basic knowledge in a setting beyond the classroom. Typically this  takes the form of an off-campus environmental studies course/program,  internship, or research project.&nbsp; Students  wishing to count courses not specifically designated as satisfying requirements  for the major may petition the Environmental Studies Advisory Board prior to  enrollment.</p>
              <p>The program offers a  concentration in environmental studies for students wishing to complement a  disciplinary major with a smaller core of courses focused on the environment. </p>

              <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-137"></a>137 Introduction to Environmental Studies</p>
<p>This interdisciplinary seminar uses basic concepts of environmental science to explore global
environmental issues. Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and
participants will recognize many of the seminar issues from coverage in the media. Because
most environmental problems involve issues beyond the science, the seminar examines the
economic, political and ethical dimensions of environmental questions and environmental
decision-making.  Offered each semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-201"></a>201 Topics in Global Environmental Politics</p>
<p>Population growth, industrialization, and the consumption of fossil fuels have increased global
environmental problems. The course examines the ways in which nation-states and/or
international institutions have addressed these environmental concerns. Depending on the
instructor, the focus of the course is either the environmental problems of a particular area
(e.g., Latin America, Russia or Asia) or a broader global arena (e.g., international institutions
and the environment). Offered annually.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-202"></a>202 The Culture of Nature</p>
<p>This American environmental history explores the social construction of nature in the 20th century,
looking at the roots (both natural and cultural) of contemporary environmental issues. To figure
out what nature means to us now, students study the history of stuff, the culture of grasslands and
lawns, the changing character of the city and the country, the nature of the suburbs, the
conservation and preservation movements, different energy ecologies, the nature of TV, the
contemporary environmental movement, and alternative ecological practices. They also use the
St. Olaf campus as a case study of 20th-century environmental design. Offered annually.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-222"></a>222 Campus Ecology</p>
<p>This course explores key concepts of ecology, focusing explicitly on the ideal of ecological
sustainability for the St. Olaf College campus.  Students attend both to contemporary environmental
issues and to the ideas and institutions that shape human resource use.  Working groups research
