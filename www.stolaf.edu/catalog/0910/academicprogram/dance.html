              <p> <span class="programdescription">Dancing  is moving, exploring, creating, knowing ourselves as whole people.  Since time began, dance has threaded itself through the fabric of  personal, social, cultural, and religious traditions.  It excites, invigorates, and entices us, echoing our life experiences.  Dance reflects our human desire to shape feelings, ideas, and images  with an aesthetic sensibility. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Creating  dance opens up new connections within ourselves, with others, and with  entire communities. At St. Olaf we lace together a dance experience  which emphasizes the American modern dance tradition in its technical training, while encouraging study and performance  of styles and dances from world cultures. Performance opportunities  range from main stage productions to informal showings, from chapel  services to off-campus events. </p>

               <p><span class="body">In  combining studio and theory work, the dance major prepares students for  a variety of life and career possibilities. Recent graduates perform  with professional companies or as free-lance  artists. Others pursue graduate study in dance therapy, teaching, choreography, performance, or the  somatic disciplines. The emerging fields of dance medicine and dance technology will beckon  many in the future, as will careers in arts/dance administration, dance  in the church, or teaching in public schools, private studios, or  community service agencies. </span>
