              <p> <span class="programdescription">Nursing, the largest of the health professions, is founded on a commitment of service to others  and focuses on the health and well being of society. Nursing practice  involves four areas: promoting health and wellness, preventing illness,  restoring health, and care of the dying. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Minnesota Intercollegiate Nursing Consortium (MINC), the nursing  program at St. Olaf working in cooperation with that of Gustavus  Adolphus College, offers students the opportunity to enjoy a St. Olaf  education, earn a bachelor of arts degree with a major in nursing,  enroll in nursing courses with students outside the major and from  another college, enjoy courses taught by professors from two colleges,  and have clinical learning experiences in a wide variety of local and  Twin Cities medical and health care centers, long-term care facilities,  community agencies, home health, and other facilities. By combining the  values of the individual and a liberal arts background with the  acquisition of professional knowledge and nursing skills, the program  integrates development of the whole person, a commitment to life-long learning, and service to others with a holistic approach to the practice of professional nursing. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  program, which is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing  Education and has been approved by the Minnesota Board of Nursing,  spans four academic years. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Upon  graduation, students are eligible to apply for initial licensure by  examination for registered nurses offered by the National Council of  State Boards of Nursing and, upon licensure, they can apply for certification as a public health nurse in Minnesota. </p>
            </div>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">The  program, through an innovative design that integrates theory with  practice and partners educators with professionals in practice,  prepares graduates to provide and coordinate nursing care for  individuals, families, and communities within standards of professional  practice utilizing the Neuman Systems Model. Students learn to think  critically, communicate effectively, and implement therapeutic nursing  interventions within the sociocultural, spiritual, and developmental context of patient situations. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Graduates  are qualified to work in hospitals, public health agencies, and  clinics, to give high quality nursing care to patients and families,  and to direct the nursing care given by others. They have the background  for graduate study in nursing programs, which can prepare them for  advanced nursing practice, teaching, administration, and research. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL </h5>
              <p class="body"> Information  regarding the national accreditation status of the program can be  obtained from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE),  One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 530, Washington,  DC 20036-1120, (202) 887-6791. Information regarding state approval of  the program is available from the Minnesota Board of Nursing, 2829  University Ave., Suite 500, Minneapolis, MN 55414, (612) 617-2270. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS For THE MAJOR </h5>
              <div>
                <h6> <span class="body">Admission and Progression </span></h6>
                <p><span class="body"> Students  are encouraged to express an interest in the nursing major upon  application for admission to St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the  program is limited and admission is competitive; therefore, early consultation  with the department chair is recommended. Interested students are  assigned nursing faculty as academic advisors. Recognizing the  cooperative relationship that exists between Gustavus Adolphus College  and St. Olaf College as participants in the Minnesota Intercollegiate  Nursing Consortium (MINC), no college in MINC will accept, as transfers  in nursing, students who have taken the prenursing or nursing curriculum from the other institution in the consortium. In exceptional circumstances (e.g. withdrawal from college for a period of one year), a student may petition to the MINC director for an exception to this policy. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> Students must apply for admission to the nursing major during the fall of the sophomore year. Application  information is available from the department chair or website. Admission criteria  include cumulative grade point average, grades in prerequisite courses,  essay, interview, and student status. Students will be notified of  their conditional acceptance into the major by a letter from the  department chair before the Spring Semester of the sophomore year.  Nursing courses begin in the fall of junior year. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> Conditional acceptance into the nursing major will become final if students meet the following criteria  at the end of the sophomore year: a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.85 and  successful completion of all nursing prerequisite courses with a GPA of 2.70. Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade. Only one prerequisite  course may be below C-, and this course (or an alternate course  approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once. A  minimum grade of C- must be achieved in the repeated or substituted  course. If a grade of C- is not achieved in the repeated or substituted  course, the student may not continue in the major. If two or more  prerequisite courses are below C- the student may not continue in the  major. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> Students  not accepted may choose to be placed on a waiting list and will be  notified of their rank on that list. If openings occur, admission will  be offered to waiting list students by rank, highest rank first.  Students on the waiting list may also reapply for admission to the  nursing program the following year. They will be considered in the next  pool of applicants but will not be guaranteed admission because they  apply a second time. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body">In the event that a student is denied admission to the program by the department of nursing, and is subsequently unsuccessful in appealing the decision within the department, the student may appeal to the Academic Dean, who will ask for a written statement from both the student and the department prior to rendering a decision. The Dean's decision will be final. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> In  addition to the college health requirements, nursing students must also  provide documentation of: immunization to Hepatitis B, measles, mumps,  varicella and rubella, and negative Mantoux or Tine (TB) test or  negative chest x-ray after June 1 of both the junior and senior years  in the major. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> Continuous  certification in CPR (Basic Life Support for health providers) must be  maintained throughout the major according to American Heart Association  guidelines. Students should complete a CPR course prior to beginning  nursing courses that meets these guidelines and provides certification  for the two-year period they are enrolled in the major. </span></p>
                <p><span class="body"> In  order to be qualified to provide direct patient services, students must  undergo an annual criminal background study conducted by the Minnesota  Department of Human Services (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by  the MDHS, he or she will be unable to provide direct patient care.  Direct patient care is a requirement of the nursing major. If a student  is disqualified and cannot provide direct patient care, he or she will  be dismissed from the nursing program. </span></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6><span class="body"> Requirements for Graduation </span></h6>
                <p><span class="body"> Students  must meet all college requirements for graduation, as well as complete  eight prerequisite courses, one supporting course and 11 upper division  nursing courses. The required courses are Nursing 302, 304, 306, 308,  336, 338, 386, 388, 392, and 397. </span></p>

                <h6><span class="body"> Prerequisite Courses </span></h6>
                <p><span class="body"> Eight courses to be completed before beginning upper division nursing courses are:  Biology 125, 231, 243; one of Chemistry 111, 121, or 125; Nursing 110;  Psychology 125 and 241; one of Sociology 121, 128, 260, or 264. A  course in ethics must be completed before graduation. Students should  consult with their advisor to determine what courses meet this  requirement for nursing from general education EIN courses. </span></p>
              </div>
            </div>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-status.html#distinct">DISTINCTION</a> </h5>
          <p> <span class="body">The  Department of Nursing seeks to recognize senior students who  distinguish themselves through an independent project which goes beyond  the requirements of the major. Candidates are evaluated for the extent  to which they: synthesize and integrate knowledge from the basic  sciences and the liberal arts in nursing care; apply cognitive,  interpersonal, and psychomotor skills to the nursing care of patients  through the nursing process; demonstrate accountability for the quality  of their own nursing interventions  and independence in decision making; demonstrate leadership skills in  relation with patients, peers, nursing, and other health team members  and in functions relating to professional nursing; demonstrate  participation in extra-curricular activities; and demonstrate the  ability to develop a creative project with relevance to nursing. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Students  with a grade point average of 3.5 or above in the nursing courses  completed at the point of application  are eligible to be candidates for departmental  distinction. Guidelines for distinction are available from the nursing  office. </p>

              <div>
                <h6> <span class="body">Study Abroad </span></h6>
                <p><span class="body"> Nursing  students at St. Olaf can participate in the Study/Service or Semester  Abroad programs listed in the International Studies section of the  catalog. However, participants in programs abroad most likely will need  additional time to complete all requirements for the nursing major. The  nursing advisor or the department chair will assist in planning for  these experiences. </span></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6><span class="body"> Second Majors </span></h6>
                <p><span class="body"> Undergraduates may choose to earn a double major at St. Olaf, in nursing and another discipline. Additional  time may be necessary for this choice, as well as advising by faculty  representing both disciplines. Students who have already earned a St.  Olaf degree are eligible to earn a second major in nursing. Students should consult with the department chair to determine prerequisite courses needed prior to beginning the nursing courses. Special tuition charges are possible. </span></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="programdescription"> Nursing  courses that count toward the major are upper division (junior and  senior years). Courses progress from nonacute to acute nursing, from  simple to complex situations and include care of the individual, the family, and the community. Each nursing course that counts toward the major provides the student with 39 class  periods, or the equivalent, of instruction. One class period equals 55  minutes at St. Olaf. Three and a half hours of classroom laboratory or  clinical laboratory is the equivalent of one class period. Clinical  experiences are provided in each semester of the nursing major in a variety of rural and metropolitan settings. Students must provide their own transportation to clinical experiences. Nursing  faculty design and evaluate all classroom and laboratory experiences;  in some courses registered nurses working as adjunct instructors assist  faculty to guide student learning in the classroom or clinical  laboratories. A fee is assessed each semester for off-campus program expenses. </p>
