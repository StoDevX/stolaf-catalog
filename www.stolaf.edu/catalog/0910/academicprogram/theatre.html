              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2009-10:</strong> Brian Bjorklund, design and production </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2009-10:</strong> Todd Edwards, design and production; Dona Freeman, acting; Gary Gisselman, acting, directing; Karen Peterson Wilson, theater, voice/phonetics, oral interpretation; William Sonnega, theater, media studies; Jeanne Willcoxon, acting, theater history </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  St. Olaf Department of Theatre takes for its subject matter all aspects  of making theater. It produces a season of plays whose focus is the  liberal arts curriculum rather than a typical theater company&rsquo;s season  of plays. All courses focus on the making of dramatic art. Courses in  history and theory, no less than those in acting, directing, and  design, approach the problems and difficulties of making production  their central issue. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  activities and skills necessary for learning about and making theater  are well suited to learning about and contributing to lives of worth  and service. The basic theater activity is making things: play scripts,  sets, costumes, characters, and the complete works of which these are a  part. The theater skills are leading, following, reading, writing,  talking, drawing, building, acting, performing, and making  arrangements. We place these skills in the service of our conception of  theater as a way of knowing. Our courses, along with the rest of the college  curriculum, develop an appreciation of the need for moral choice, an  imagination that constructs and examines alternatives, and an  understanding of creativity as a reality in the world and an agency of  community and change. We think of the program as a kind of laboratory for a serious and productive life. This is what we mean when we call the study of theater at St. Olaf a liberal arts major. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> In  contemporary culture, theater and the entertainment industry overlap,  with the result that public approbation and artistic success have  become difficult to separate. Our program emphasizes process as well as  public performance. Students learn to judge their own  work according to principles  derived from the art itself. And as part of the fine arts at St. Olaf,  we also emphasize collaboration and the interdisciplinary nature of  theater. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The St. Olaf College Theatre Department is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
              <p class="body">The basic theatre major is nine courses plus four 0.25 credit practicums. The major requirement includes an introductory course and coursework in acting, directing, design, technical production, and history of theater. Students also take one upper level course in theater topics. The requirements for the major are designed to provide a well-rounded course of study in the theater discipline. The co-curricular theater production program serves as a lab for our courses and offers extended learning and experience for St. Olaf students.</p>

        <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE THEATRE MAJOR </p>
    <div>
      <p> <span class="body">The  major requires a minimum of nine courses, of which two must be from  Level I, two from Level II and three from Level III, plus four  practicum quarter credits.

Course Requirements: Theatre  110, 130 or 131, 150 or 250, 232, 270, 271, 352, 379 or 380, plus one  additional course selected from: Theatre 338, 379, 380, 394, 398.

              <h5 class="goldhead"> THEATER TEACHING LICENSE </h5>
              <p class="body"> St. Olaf offers a K-12 teaching license in theater. Contact Brian Bjorklund, Theatre department chair or Maria Kelly, Education department chair, for further information. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">Special Programs</p>
              <p class="body">Students have the opportunity to study Theatre in London during the January term as part of a regular course taught by theatre faculty. Students can set up internship experiences with theaters and other arts organizations in the Twin Cities and surrounding areas. Courses in the department regularly attend professional theater performances in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Guest artists from those theaters often visit the courses in the department to talk about and demonstrate their work and occasionally collaborate in the production work for our season of plays.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate and professional study</p>
              <p class="body">Students planning on graduate study in theater should take the graduation major and additional courses for a total not to exceed 14.00 credits. Students should work closely with a faculty member in the area of their interest to plan their program. Students who are considering professional work in the theater or related arts should work together with faculty to develop appropriate resume or portfolio documents prior to graduation.</p>
