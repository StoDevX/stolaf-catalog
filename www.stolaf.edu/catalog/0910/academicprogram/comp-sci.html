              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2009-10:</strong> Richard J. Allen (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), logic programming, intelligent tutoring systems;  Richard A. Brown (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), parallel systems, formal methods, software-supported pedagogy (on leave Interim and Spring Semester); Charles W. Huff, Jr. (Psychology), social psychology, ethical and social issues in computing; Steven C.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Computer  science (CS) is the academic discipline that focuses on creative  computing-related problem solving and develops valuable analytical  skills in theory, abstraction, and design. St. Olaf&rsquo;s CS program  employs &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; experience to build up valuable technical skills  while reinforcing powerful computing concepts in a liberal arts  context. Beginning with the introductory  Computer Science 121, the program&rsquo;s courses draw connections with  applications in other disciplines and in areas such as multimedia  computing. The program offers an authentic  and satisfying education in the concepts and practices of computer  science; the courses below represent national expectations for an  undergraduate computer science curriculum. Undergraduate research  appears throughout the program, from foundation courses that develop  valuable project skills to advanced courses such as the Senior Capstone  Seminar. The program also incorporates a distinct liberal arts  perspective, including emphasis on teamwork and communication skills,  examination of ethical and social issues in computing, and collaboration in upper-level interdisciplinary projects. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Although CS differs from other computing areas, such as programming, information technology  (IT), and information systems (IS), the study of computer science  serves as excellent preparation for careers in such fields, because the  concepts of computer science provide insights into all forms of  computing. While specific computing systems come and go, the principles  of CS endure for the long term, and persons with awareness of those  principles perceive them in all forms of computing. The program's  emphases on development of creative problem-solving and analytical  thinking abilities, interpersonal skills, and ethical analysis and  awareness enhance any career, whether one becomes a computing  professional or an occasional user. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> overview of the major</h5>
              <p class="body">The CS Program offers an authentic and satisfying education in the concepts and practices of computer science. The major begins with breadth-first foundation courses that present the nature of CS. The foundation and subsequent core courses together span the national expectations for an undergraduate computer science major curriculum, and advanced courses and electives provide options for depth. Several themes appear throughout the major: breadth-first introductory courses; team collaboration (often interdisciplinary); development of communication skills; thoughtful, structured analysis of ethical and social issues in computing; and undergraduate research, beginning with project skills in early courses and continuing through advanced experiences such as the Senior Capstone Seminar CS 390.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">A  student arranges for a computer science major by individual contract  with the computer science faculty. This provides some latitude for  choice according to individual interests and background and allows the  computer science faculty to update the curriculum easily as the field  of computer science evolves. Most contracts adhere to the guidelines  below, which derive from prominent national recommendations for  undergraduate computer science majors. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Foundation courses: Either Computer Science 121, 251 and 252, or Computer Science 225; Computer Science 231; Computer Science 241. </p>
              <p class="body"> Core courses: Computer Science 253; Computer Science 263; either Computer Science  276 or 333; and either Computer Science 273 or 284. </p>
              <p class="body">Electives and capstone: Computer Science 390 and two approved electives. </p>
              <p class="body">These guidelines represent four levels: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body"> a breadth-first introduction to the discipline, through a hands-on survey of concepts (Computer Science  121 or 225) and three &ldquo;second courses&rdquo; (Computer Science 231, 241, 251)  that may be taken in any order (note that the foundation courses offer  non-majors a variety of one- to four-course samples of computer  science); </li>
                <li class="body"> core  courses in standard computer science topics, including algorithms and  data structures, ethics of computing, computer languages, and computer  systems; </li>

<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
          <p class="body">Certain courses in computer science count toward a concentration in linguistics and toward majors in mathematics and biology. Also, certain courses in mathematics and physics can count toward requirements in a computer science major contract. Speak with the computer science program director for details.</p>
              <p class="body">The computer science program offers many opportunities to participate in undergraduate research, often integrated within courses, or through extracurricular activities such as summer research. Ongoing efforts in high-performance cluster computing and with graphics and 3D computer vision, plus interdisciplinary applications of these techniques in biological sciences, robotics, and other areas, provide a foundation for many student projects.</p>
              <p class="body">A biennial international experience, co-sponsored with the biology department, brings computing enrichment to a high school in Chennai, India.</p>
          <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY</p>
              <p class="body">Students considering graduate study in computer science should pursue opportunities that add both breadth and depth in their majors. Standard course offerings provide breadth, in that taking all foundation and core courses plus Computer Science 336 collectively includes material from all 63 required units in the ACM/IEEE national curricular recommendations, plus over 20 optional units. Graduate-school-bound students are strongly encouraged to pursue undergraduate research involving computer science, and to take courses beyond the basic major requirements. </p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">COURSES </h5>
              <p class="body">Courses in computer science satisfy the following general education requirements: MAR/AQR, WRI, ORC, NSC and EIN. See the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedule</a> for details. </p>
