For instance, seniors may spend one of their last terms at another institution only if a maximum of three credits are applied to the St. Olaf degree. A senior may spend the final semester on a St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus program. See, however, <a href="../academicregs/graduating.html#commencement">PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT. </a></span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subhead"><b>3. <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/intinfo.html">January Interim</a></b></p>
            <p class="body">At least three of the required 35  credits must be earned in three separate January full-credit (1.0) Interims. An Interim may be taken on campus, through a St. Olaf off-campus Interim program, or through an approved Interim exchange with another 4-1-4 college. Transfer students admitted with at least sophomore standing must complete two Interims. After having successfully completed two Interims, senior participators may satisfy the third Interim requirement by means of  a summer course taken during a St. Olaf summer session after the commencement in which the student participates.</p>
        <p class="subhead"><b>4. Grade Points and Grade Point Average</b></p>
            <p class="body">An average grade of C (2.00 on a 4.00 system) for all courses taken for the usual letter grades. See <a href="../academicregs/counting-courses.html#gpa">GRADE POINT AVERAGE</a> for details. </p>

            <p class="body">A course can earn only its assigned level. It cannot be raised in level as the result of extra studies, assignments, or performance. </p>

            <p class="body">A minimum of 24 credits out of 35 must be taken graded through courses taken from a St. Olaf professor.</p>
            <p class="body">A sliding scale is used if not all work is taken at St. Olaf or if credit is earned through special programs such as Advanced Placement.  Sophomore transfer students need a minimum of 18 graded credits and junior transfer students a minimum of 13 graded credits. Details are available from the registrar. </p>
        <p class="body">All students should be aware of the restrictions on <a href="../academicregs/coursereg.html#su">S/U and P/N grades</a>. </p>
            <p><span class="body">Students studying on St. Olaf off-campus programs should refer to <a href="../academicregs/counting-courses.html#graded">GRADED AND UNGRADED COURSES </a> in the Academic Regulations section of this catalog for details about how this graduation requirement is affected by off-campus programs. </span> </p>
            <p class="subhead"><b>7. Major &mdash; 8 or More  Credits</b></p>
        <p class="body">One completed major is required for graduation. Depending on the department or interdisciplinary program, the number of courses required for a major ranges from eight to twelve courses, with some departments recommending course work in other departments. Departments and interdisciplinary programs may require comprehensive examinations or special research projects. (See <a href="../academiclife/majors-and-more.html">MAJORS AND MORE.</a>) Consult the <a href="../academicprogram/index.html">department or interdisciplinary program listing</a> in this catalog for specific requirements. Students must declare a major no later than the time of registration for interim and semester II of their junior year by filling out a form available at the registrar&rsquo;s office. Students are allowed to change this declaration or add a second major at a later date. Only this catalog defines the specific requirements for each departmental or interdisciplinary major. </p>
            <p class="body">Other regulations are: </p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">Of the  credits counting toward the minimum requirements for a major, a total of six (6.00) must be completed with a grade of C or higher. </li>
              <li class="body">Only one full-course equivalent (1.00 credit course) taken S/U may count toward the minimum requirements for a major. Some departments have more stringent regulations. </li>
              <li class="body">At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St. Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the appropriate department chair or program director about counting toward a major courses taken at other colleges. The chair must sign the student&rsquo;s transfer of credit form (available from the Registrar&rsquo;s Office) if work from other institutions is accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-campus programs must be approved by the chair/director and the off-campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major is sought. (See <a href="../academicregs/transferring.html#transfercourses">TRANSFERRING CREDITS TO ST. OLAF </a>) </li>
              <li class="body">Certification of a completed major is the responsibility and prerogative of the department chair or program director, not the registrar.</li>
              <li class="body">Graduation requirements for majors within the <a href="../academicprogram/music.html#bm">Bachelor of Music</a> degree may vary widely. Students should consult this catalog and the <a href="../academicprogram/music.html">Music Department</a> chair. </li>
              <li class="body">See below, <a href="general-requirements.html#outside">Credits Outside the Major.</a></li>
            </ol>
        <p class="subhead">Multiple Majors: </b></p>
            <p class="body">Attaining two or three majors within the confines of 35 credits is often difficult. Students should consult frequently with their advisor and the chair or director of the major departments and programs. Three regulations are important: </p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">21 full-course credits outside of the SIS &quot;department&quot; code of the major are required for graduation. Courses applied to an additional major, as well as Education Department courses attending a major, count toward the 21 &ldquo;outside&rdquo; credits. 21 credits outside of each of the second or third majors are required in order to certify those majors as complete and recorded on the student&rsquo;s transcript. </li>
              <li class="body">A graduate may add an additional major to the St. Olaf record if no more than two courses from another institution are subsequently applied to the additional major. </li>
              <li>
                <div align="left" class="body"> Certification of a completed major is the responsibility and prerogative of the department chair or program director, not the registrar. </div>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="subhead"><b><a name="outside" id="outside"></a>8. Credits Outside the Major </b></p>
            <p class="body">While the maximum course credits in any one department allowed toward the 35 full course credits graduation requirement may vary, 21 total credits must be completed outside of the SIS &quot;department&quot; code of the major. In order for a student to be certified in a second or third major, 21 credits also must be taken outside of the SIS &quot;department&quot; code of each of those majors as well.  If a student has a double major, courses taken in the second major count toward the 21 credits outside of the first major. Credits outside the major department or program include full (1.00) credit courses plus partial (.25 and .50) credit courses. </p>
            <p class="subhead"><b>9. Completion of Incomplete Grades</b></p>
            <p class="body">A student with an <a href="../academicregs/counting-courses.html#incompletes">incomplete</a> on his/her academic record may participate in Commencement if all other requirements for graduation have been met (see<a href="../academicregs/graduating.html#commencement"> PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT</a>). Only after a final grade has been recorded for the course, however, will a degree be conferred and a diploma issued. </p>
            <p><span class="subhead">10. <span class="subhead">Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Music Double Degree Option</span> </span>(approved by the Faculty, April 5, 2007):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Students must meet the application requirements for both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degree programs.</li>
              <li>Students engage in professional study in music and study in the liberal arts, leading to both Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Arts degrees. </li>
              <li>The duration of the double-degree option may vary among disciplines but will be less than the sum of the durations of both degree programs if undertaken separately. For most students, pursuit of a double-degree option will require five years of study. It should be noted that in a few cases (notably when the BA graduation major is in the natural sciences) completion of all requirements in five years may not be possible.</li>
              <li>Students pursuing the double-degree option may choose any of the four Bachelor of Music graduation majors (Church Music, Music Education, Performance, and Theory/Composition) and any of the Bachelor of Arts graduation majors except Music.</li>
              <li>Students shall meet the requirements for the BA graduation major and BM graduation major, as well as the general and comprehensive graduation requirements for the two degrees. The final two years of coursework in pursuit of the degrees must be spent in residence. A minimum of 43 full course credits must be completed with the last 17 full course credits earned through St. Olaf.</li>
              <li>Students required to continue study in a fifth year to complete two degrees are eligible for continuing financial aid from St. Olaf College.</li>
              <li>A double-degree student may elect to graduate in two different semesters, one with each degree, but must meet all requirements for the degree and the graduation major within that degree before the diploma for that degree will be awarded.</li>
              <li>Graduating double-degree students receive two diplomas, one for each degree.</li>
            </ul>
