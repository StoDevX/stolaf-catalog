            <p class="programname">Admissions
              Procedures
            </p>
            <p><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/">http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/</a> </p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>St. Olaf College seeks to assemble a student body which reflects a variety of geographic, cultural, economic, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. We want each class to be a diverse and energetic group of students eager to undertake the challenges of a liberal arts education. Admissions decisions take into consideration academic achievement, academic aptitude, and personal qualifications as well as leadership and significant involvement in school and community. </em></p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>If you have questions about the application process, please contact the Admissions Office at 800-800-3025. Many students find a campus visit helpful in their search for a college. If you would like information about scheduling a campus visit, please contact the campus visit coordinator at 800-800-3025 or 800-ASKOLAF (800-275-6523). </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDED PREPARATION </p>
              <p class="body">A secondary school program combining breadth and depth is an excellent preparation for study at St. Olaf. Advanced Placement or enriched courses, when available, are particularly helpful. We recommend a program of study that includes the following: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body"> Four years of English;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of mathematics;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of natural science;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of social studies; and</li>
                <li class="body"> Two to four years of the same second language, including
                          study in the senior year.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="body">We advise students to pursue an academically rigorous high school program that emphasizes creativity, writing, and critical analysis. Analytic and quantitative skills developed in such courses as trigonometry and pre-calculus are important for all students. In addition, we encourage students to take academic electives such as computer science, economics, the fine arts, geography, journalism, sociology, speech, and world history. Keyboarding, word processing, health, and physical education, while valued, are not appropriate substitutes for academic subjects. </p>
              <p class="body">Careful attention is given to each application, and explanation of special circumstances are encouraged. St. Olaf offers a variety of courses designed to meet the diverse needs and qualifications of entering students. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">Application Requirements </p>
              <p class="body">Each application for admission is reviewed on its merit. Applicants to St. Olaf must submit: </p>
