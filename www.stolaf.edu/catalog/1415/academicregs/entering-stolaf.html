In some cases, these courses may make use of distance education methods. The college or university either trains the high school teacher and reviews the program or provides a college instructor for the course.

    St. Olaf College awards a maximum of 6.00 (six) St. Olaf-equivalent credits from among all pre-college (PSEO/CIS/AP/IB/Cambridge A Level) credits presented by matriculating first-year students. The registrar first awards credit for the AP/IB/Cambridge A Level  exams that qualify. If the six pre-college credits allowed are not fulfilled by AP/IB/Cambridge A Level  credits alone, then the registrar can award up to a maximum of four of the six allowable pre-college credits through approved PSEO/CIS courses. In extraordinary circumstances, students may submit a request for an exception to the four-course limit on PSEO credits. For guidelines and procedures, consult the registrar. </span>
        <p class="body">An official transcript, requested by the student and sent directly to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office from the college or university certifying the credit (PSEO, CIS), or an official report (AP/IB/Cambridge A Level), is required for consideration of awarding St. Olaf credit. </p>
            <p class="body"> PSEO or CIS courses do not reduce the 24 graded-course-credit requirement for all degree-seeking students. </p>
            <p class="body">Pre-college courses may each, when appropriate as determined by the registrar, count toward only one general education credit except for the MCD, MCG, or WRI attributes, which may be awarded in conjunction with a second general education attribute. Students may fulfill a maximum of one of the two requirements in each of HBS and HWC via pre-college credit. Only one of the two natural science requirements, SED and IST, may be fulfilled by pre-college credit. A maximum of six (6.00) GE requirements may be fulfilled via pre-college course credit. See additional degree information regarding <a href="../academiclife/gen-ed-requirements.html">general education requirements</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li class="body">Credit for work done at other regionally accredited colleges or universities, if satisfactory in grade and applicable toward a liberal arts degree, is generally allowed to count toward a bachelor&rsquo;s degree at St. Olaf, with some restrictions; see #6 below. A &ldquo;regionally accredited college or university&rdquo; is defined as a liberal arts institution accredited by an approved regional accrediting commission. St. Olaf excludes vocational, technical, business, and on-line/correspondence institutions, even if regionally accredited.</li>
  <li class="body">The following are not transferable as St. Olaf credit: courses that are essentially workshops, camps, summer theater, guides, summer jobs, assistantships, and travel programs; music ensemble participation credits (band, choir, orchestra, etc.); intercollegiate athletic participation;  internships and/or independent study courses taken through another regionally accredited college or university. Courses of fewer than four weeks in length (regardless of the number of class contact hours) are not transferable as St. Olaf credit. Students considering &ldquo;Extension School&rdquo; courses at the University of Minnesota or elsewhere must check with the registrar. </li>
  <li class="body">Credit will not normally be given for courses taken at another institution while a student is enrolled in courses at St. Olaf.</li>
  <li class="body"><span class="body">One St. Olaf course credit is equivalent to 4.00 semester or 5.50 quarter credits. A course must meet the normal requirements of a minimum of 38 class contact hours to qualify for St. Olaf credit.</span>  
  <li class="body"><span class="body">Completed transfer credit of all types is processed as follows: the sum of all eligible semester credits and the sum of all eligible quarter credits are separately converted to St. Olaf credit, using the transfer credit scale below. The sum of the converted subtotals is the total number of St. Olaf course credits allowed in transfer.<br />

  <li><span class="body">Only courses graded  C or higher at the original institution are given credit for appropriate courses through transfer. The actual grades earned at other institutions are entered on the student&rsquo;s St. Olaf record but are not considered graded courses that count toward the St. Olaf grade point average. The college does not accept courses awarded pass (P) or satisfactory (S) grades from other institutions.</span></li>
  <li><span class="body">Non-St. Olaf off-campus work during summer school or a term or more of an academic year through another college/university must be evaluated and approved by the registrar in advance. Students must submit a <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/registrar/files/2012/11/PermissionTransferCreditFormFEB2014.pdf">transfer of credit form</a> for pre-approval. The student is given a copy of the approved form as a receipt; the registrar retains the original. An official transcript reflecting the completed course work at the host college/university must be sent by that institution directly to the St. Olaf registrar before credit transfer can be considered. The registrar may also request a photocopy or printed copy of the Web pages of the relevant portion of the host college&rsquo;s catalog and the class schedule, course outlines, or syllabi. </span></li>
  <li><span class="body"> Current students should be aware of restrictions on the number of courses that can be transferred from other institutions. After students have matriculated at St. Olaf, unless they are transfer students, they may subsequently transfer a maximum of 4.00 equivalent St. Olaf courses from other colleges or universities to St. Olaf for degree credit; only two (2) general education requirements may be awarded. This applies, as well, to students who take a leave of absence from St. Olaf. <em>A transfer student may be allowed fewer than four equivalent St. Olaf credits after matriculation, depending upon the total credits initially transferred</em>. The specific number allowed is found on the student&rsquo;s degree audit. 
    Course credits earned on St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus programs or through inter-registration with Carleton College or an approved Interim exchange program are excluded from these restrictions. </span></li>

  <li><span class="body">Juniors and seniors planning transfer work from other institutions must be aware of the St. Olaf senior residency requirement. New transfer students must complete a minimum of 17.00 credits at St. Olaf or through St. Olaf programs.

    As of August 2014, at least four (4.00) semester or five and one-half quarter credits  are required for a transfer course to fulfill a particular general education requirement. A course worth fewer than four semester or five and one-half quarter credits cannot by itself satisfy a St. Olaf general education requirement or be applied to a major.  <br />
