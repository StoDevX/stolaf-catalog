      <p class="body">See <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/registrar/ferpa/">St. Olaf College Guidelines for the Release of Student Information under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a> for St. Olaf's policy on release of students' academic information to third parties, including parents.</p>
      <p class="body">In compliance with the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/registrar/ferpa/">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a>, under no condition can grades be reported by telephone or to third parties, including parents, without specific written and signed authorization by the student. </p>
      <p class="goldhead"><a name="graded" id="graded"></a>GRADED AND UNGRADED CREdits</p>
      <p class="body">A minimum of 24  graded credits out of 35 credits is required for graduation. &quot;Graded credits&quot; are credits awarded via courses taught by St. Olaf faculty. In most cases, these courses are taught on campus or through approved St. Olaf off-campus programs. A course taught at another institution by a St. Olaf faculty member also counts as a graded credit.</p>
      <p class="body">The graded credit requirement is reduced by scale in the following instances: </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="body">A student is admitted and matriculates at St. Olaf as a transfer student; see scale below.</li>
        <li class="body">Credits  are transferred into St. Olaf from another institution following  matriculation at St Olaf. Exception: Credits taken on an off-campus  program through another institution will not reduce the number of graded course credits required  for graduation.</li>
        <li class="body">Credits transferred from PSEO, CIS, AP, IB do not reduce the number of graded credits required.</li>
        <li class="body"> Credits earned on St. Olaf off-campus programs that total
          two semesters in length.

            <p class="body">A course taught by a St. Olaf instructor on an off-campus program is considered a graded course and counts toward the 24 required if taken for a letter grade. </p>
            <p class="body">The letter grades from a  full-year St. Olaf off-campus program or the combination of two semester-length St. Olaf off-campus programs are not computed in the grade point average unless taught by a St. Olaf instructor.

      <p class="body">A grade point average of C (2.00) is required for graduation. </p>
      <p class="body">The grade point average (GPA) is based upon final grades for all course work taken at St. Olaf as well as for grades earned through inter-registration at Carleton College and grades earned through the Minnesota Intercollegiate Nursing Consortium (MINC) program, where there is a completed major in nursing. </p>
      <p class="body">Grades and grade points for courses transferred from other institutions are not computed in the St. Olaf grade point average. Graded courses from St. Olaf off-campus programs are not computed in the grade point average except for courses taught by St. Olaf instructors.</p>
      <p class="body">Grades earned S/U or P/N and scores earned through  Advanced Placement (AP), Cambridge A Level Exams,  International Baccalaurate (IB), College in the Schools (CIS), Post-Secondary Education Option (PSEO), or other pre-college credit are not computed in the grade point average. </p>
      <p class="body">The grade point average shows two decimal places (3.15, 2.36, etc.) and is never rounded up or down. It is determined by dividing the total number of St. Olaf, MINC, and Carleton-graded courses into the total grade points. </p>
      <p class="body">If a student takes additional St. Olaf courses after s/he graduates, the rank in class remains based on the GPA at the time of graduation, even though the GPA may change with the additional coursework. A course taken prior to graduation but repeated following graduation does not change the student's GPA at graduation.</p>

<p class="body">A student has one year to notify the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising of a grade error on the transcript. A grade error is a recording mistake made by the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising. </p>
      <p class="body">Grade changes, on the other hand, are initiated by the instructor issuing the original grade, either because the instructor notices the error or following a student inquiry. The intended purpose of the grade change procedure is to correct an instructor&rsquo;s computational or other error in reporting a grade, not to represent additional work on the part of the student. The only allowable grade changes based on additional student work require formal approval of an <a href="grades.html#incompletes"> incomplete</a>. The instructor (both instructors of a team-taught course) submits a grade change request to the registrar for consideration. If the request is approved, the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising informs both the student and the instructor. </p>
      <p class="body">After determining that   a grade was not posted in error, students wishing to appeal a grade   must write a letter of appeal to the chair or director of the   instructor's department or program. </p>
      <p class="goldhead"><a name="pn" id="pn"></a>P/N COURSES (PASS/NO-PASS)</p>
      <p class="body">P/N credits are earned in courses that are offered only P/N. In other words, every student taking the course is doing so on an ungraded basis. This differs from S/U grades where each student in a course may elect to take the course graded or ungraded. Courses offered only on the P/N basis, if so designated, may fulfill general education  requirements. </p>
      <p class="body"><a name="su" id="su"></a><span class="goldhead">S/U OPTION (SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY)</span></p>
      <p class="body">The intent of the S/U option is to allow students to explore areas in which they have an interest, without the grade counting in their grade point average.</p>
      <p class="body">All graded courses are open to the S/U option as distinguished from P/N (pass/no pass) courses where the ungraded option is mandatory. Neither an S nor a U figure into the grade point average. An S is awarded for a grade of C- or higher; a U is assigned for any grade of D+ or lower. A student earning a grade of D+ to F in a course taken S/U receives a U, which carries no course credit. A U cannot be assigned another type of grade at a later date.</p>
      <p class="body">Students should exercise caution in choosing to take courses on an S/U basis. Some graduate schools, for example, assume that a grade of S replaces a C or C-. </p>
      <p class="subhead">The S/U Provisions for All Students Are:</p>
      <p class="body">In completing the minimum of 35 full credits required for graduation, students may take up to six full-course equivalents (6.00 credits) on an S/U basis. </p>
      <p class="body">Of courses taken to meet general education requirements, only .25 credit courses may be taken on an S/U basis. Such courses are counted toward the six full-course equivalents allowed. Full or .50 credit courses taken S/U <strong>do not fulfill</strong> general education requirements. </p>
      <p class="body">A maximum of one full-course equivalent (1.00 credit) taken S/U may count toward the minimum requirements for a major or an interdisciplinary concentration. Individual departments/programs may have stricter rules. </p>
      <p class="body">The<a href="../academiclife/ba-gen-grad-requirements.html#graded"> 24-graded-course graduation requirement</a> must be observed. </p>
      <p class="body">Students may elect to change the grading option from graded to S/U or from S/U to graded through the deadlines designated at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising as posted on the registrar&rsquo;s calendar. </p>
      <p class="body">Courses taken S/U on St. Olaf off-campus programs count toward the six full-course equivalents allowed. This use of S/U is distinguished from off-campus courses offered P/N only. </p>
      <p class="body">Students transferring to St. Olaf, or transferring work taken at other institutions after entering St. Olaf, may be subject to additional S/U restrictions and should consult with the registrar in advance. </p>
      <p class="body">A course completed on an S/U basis may not be assigned another type of grade at a later date. If a student receives an S credit in a course, that course may not be repeated regardless of the actual reported grade. </p>
      <p class="body">No indication of S/U registration is made on a professor&rsquo;s class list. </p>
      <p class="body">Some courses are offered on the P/N basis only upon previous approval of the dean of the college; announcement is made in the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/sis/public-aclasslab.cfm">class and lab schedule. </a></p>
<p class="goldhead"><a name="incompletes" id="incompletes"></a>INCOMPLETES</p>
      <p class="body">An incomplete in a course is rarely granted and only if there is a distinct possibility of, and a commitment to, finishing the course in a timely manner. </p>
      <p class="body">A request for an incomplete is initiated by the student and submitted to the Dean of Students Office. Incompletes are granted primarily for documented medical reasons and may not be issued by an instructor without prior approval of the dean of students or one of the associate deans of students. </p>
      <p class="body">An incomplete for which a grade is not recorded by the extended deadline set at the time of approval of the incomplete automatically becomes an F. The incompleted course cannot be dropped from the record at a later date to avoid a failing grade. Once the course is completed with the assignment of a letter grade and credit, an asterisk is entered beside it on the permanent transcript indicating that the course was once incomplete. A student may not apply for an incomplete in a course added after the posted deadline because of insufficient time to complete the assigned work. A student who has been granted an incomplete in a course cannot subsequently finish the course with similar course credit transferred from another college.</p>
      <p class="body">A student with an incomplete on his/her academic record may <a href="graduating.html#commencement">participate in commencement</a> if all other requirements for graduation have been met.&nbsp; Only after a final grade has been recorded for the course, however, will a degree be conferred and a diploma issued. </p>
      <p class="body">Only in the most extraordinary circumstances are incompletes allowed on St. Olaf abroad programs not led by a St. Olaf faculty member. Many non-U.S. colleges and universities are not familiar with the practice of giving incompletes, and constraints having to do with distance and time make it very difficult to follow up on incompletes. Consequently, students studying abroad should not anticipate being able to avail themselves of this option. </p>
