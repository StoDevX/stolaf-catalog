            <p class="programname">International
                and 
              Domestic Off-Campus Studies: Overview </p>
            <p class="body">St. Olaf College, through <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/international/">International and Off-Campus Studies</a>, creates and provides programs that serve the mission of the College at sites in the United States and abroad. These programs are characterized by the integration of academic and experiential education. The experiential component of these programs amplifies and extends the liberal learning that occcurs on campus and enhances students' global perspective by helping them encounter and understand changes confronting our world in a context of global community and world citizenship.</p>
<p class="body">Around three-fourths of all St. Olaf students  participate in off-campus programs, many of them led by St. Olaf faculty  members. In recent years, around 70% of the students in every graduating class have studied internationally, in places as diverse as  Aberdeen, Bangalore, Chiang Mai, Dakar, Irkutsk and Istanbul. Around  15 percent have participated in domestic programs &mdash; ranging from Interim  courses on environmental psychology in Rocky Mountain National Park or the contemporary art scene in New   York City, to semester programs on urban studies in Chicago or politics in Washington, DC.&nbsp; A number of students find off-campus study so  valuable that they participate in two or three programs during their St. Olaf  careers.</p>
        <p class="body"> Of equal importance is the fact that
                faculty members find these programs extremely rewarding &mdash; both for their students and
              for themselves. That is why, in the more than 40 years that St.
              Olaf has been sponsoring them, the college&rsquo;s field-supervised
              programs (Mediterranean Semester, Term in Asia, Global Semester,
              and more recently, Environmental Science in Australia) have been
              led by more than 50 different professors, and 140 faculty members
            have led more than 300 off-campus Interim courses. </p>
        <p class="body"> Each off-campus offering has a program advisor. Program advisors
                are St. Olaf faculty members who are particularly well qualified
            to offer academic advice on specific programs. </p>
            <p class="body"> It is strongly recommended that all first-year students discuss
                off-campus study plans with their academic advisor and with the
                faculty program advisor or the study abroad advisor in the International
              and Off-Campus Studies Office.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Consortial Activities </p>
            <p class="body"> Exchange agreements and the college&rsquo;s
                membership in consortia make it possible for students to participate
                in a number of exciting off-campus programs in addition to the
            ones sponsored by St. Olaf itself. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is one of 14 liberal arts colleges that make up the
              Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM). Other ACM members are
              Beloit, Carleton, Coe,  Colorado,
              Cornell, Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Luther, Macalester, Monmouth,
              and Ripon. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is also a member of the Higher Education Consortium
              for Urban Affairs (HECUA), which offers students specialized programs
                in domestic and international sites focusing on community issues
                and social change.<br />
        </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Policies and Procedures </p>
            <p class="body"> Students are responsible for adhering to the
                regulations and policies contained in the <a href="../academicregs/index.html">Academic Regulations</a>              section of this catalog. In particular, students on St. Olaf
              off-campus programs are directed to refer to the policies on &ldquo;<a href="../academicregs/grades.html#graded">Graded and Ungraded Courses</a>&rdquo; for
                full details on how off-campus programs affect this graduation
                requirement.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Qualifications </p>
            <p class="body"> Nearly all St. Olaf students who study off
                campus do so during their sophomore, junior, or senior years.
                (A few Interims are open to first-year students.) The college&rsquo;s
                4-1-4 calendar (two semesters separated by an Interim in January)
                contributes to the flexibility: it enables students to participate
                in programs that last a month, a summer, a semester, half a
            year, or a full year. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students intending to take part in a recognized program off campus
              must be in good academic standing, be sufficiently mature to benefit
              from such study, and physically able to participate in the core activities of the program. Many programs
              have prerequisites, including introductory or advanced courses
              in a specific discipline or certain levels of language proficiency.
              Some programs are competitive, and applicants are accepted based
              on meeting a standard set of criteria governing the selection process.
              Details about all St. Olaf-approved Interim, summer, semester and year-long programs,
              program advisors, prerequisites, and application deadlines and procedures
              are found on the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/international/">International and Off-Campus Studies Web site</a>. The brief descriptions located in this catalog, however, will give you an idea of the breadth and depth of St. Olaf's off-campus study opportunities.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Fees </p>
            <p class="body"> Students in all St. Olaf-sponsored programs pay the St. Olaf
              tuition              plus additional travel and on-site costs that vary, depending on the nature of each off-campus program. Apart from these payments, students are expected to cover passport and visa fees, the cost of additional independent travel, and personal expenses on their own.<strong> </strong>St. Olaf financial aid is available for
              St. Olaf off-campus programs. Information about special scholarships
                  for off-campus study is available from the Financial Aid Office
                  or the study abroad advisor in the International and Off-Campus
                  Studies Office.      </p>
