              <p class="body">Each medical school (whether MD or DO), dental school and physician's assistant program differs somewhat in their exact list of courses required for admission. However, St. Olaf's <a href="../academiclife/ba-gen-ed-requirements.html">general education curriculum</a> provides you with most of the non-science prerequisites typical of these programs. The following &quot;recommended&quot; courses are recommended for all students planning on entering medical schools (either MD or DO) or dental schools.</p>
              <p class="body">Recommended coursework (for MCAT preparation and medical school admission):</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body">Math 119 or 120: <em>Calculus</em></li>
                <li class="body">2 semesters of general biology (typically Biology 150 and Biology 227)</li>

                    <li class="body">Math 119 or 120 is a prerequisite for Chemistry 126 and Chemistry/Biology 126</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="body">Chemistry 247 and Chemistry 248: <em>Organic Chemistry</em></li>
                <li class="body">Chemistry 379: <em>Biochemistry</em> (organic chemistry is a prerequisite; required at some medical schools)</li>
                <li class="body">Physics 124 and Physics 125</li>
                <li class="body">Biology 243: <em>Human Anatomy and Physiology</em> (required at some medical schools)</li>
                <li class="body">Psychology 125</li>
                <li class="body">A sociology course (121 is open to first-year students only)</li>
                <li class="body">A statistics course (typically Statistics 212)</li>
              </ul>
<p class="body">Pre-medical students should note that there is much more to being a competitive candidate for medical school than course planning. A competitive candidate to medical school might have a GPA of greater than 3.5, an MCAT score of greater than 30, significant experience with patients in a medical setting, and long-term volunteer experience (especially working with the underserved).</p>
              <p class="body">Pre-dental students should note that many dental schools recommend that students take a semester of introductory psychology, a semester of statistics, and coursework in studio art and English (e.g., composition) in addition to the recommended natural science and mathematics coursework above.</p>
              <p class="body">Prererequisites for podiatry programs are similar to those for medical school, and some podiatry schools may accept the MCAT, DAT, or GRE. A student who will use the MCAT when applying to podiatry school should take courses in psychology, sociology, and statistics in addition to the recommended natural science and mathematics courses recommended for pre-medical students. </p>
              <p class="body">Prerequisites for Physician's Assistant programs are similar, but students should note that these programs may not require organic chemistry, biochemistry or physics; however, these students are also recommended to take:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body">Psychology 125 (introductory) and Psychology 241 (developmental psychology)</li>
                <li class="body">Medical terminology (typically as Biology 291: <em>Medical Terminology</em>)</li>
                <li class="body">A course emphasizing speech and communication</li>
                <li class="body">Biology 143 and Biology 243 (2 sem sequence of Human Anatomy and Physiology)</li>

              </ul>
              <p class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate study</p>
              <p class="body">Health Professionals graduate schools (such as medical schools) are looking for well-rounded individuals who are interested in a wide variety of areas and have demonstrated their interest in both medicine and people. Students should take advantage of the many opportunities to obtain patient contact and observe practitioners at work in their field of expertise. Medically related experience is essential to successful application to many health profession programs; medical schools strongly recommend potential applicants obtain medically related work or other contact with patients, and physician assistant programs often require as many as 1500-2000 hours of work with patients before the student submits an application. The  Piper Center's coaches and peer advisors can assist students in arranging internships with physicians in their hometown, with alumni, or with healthcare professionals in the Twin Cities. Internships during the Interim and summer of the students' sophomore or junior year work well. Students may also shadow healthcare professionals during the summer, or work in a hospital, clinic, or nursing home (e.g., as a CNA); note that formal registration for credit is <u>not</u> required.</p>
              <p class="body">Some medical schools highly value research experience, whether in the laboratory, the field, or internships (such as the Mayo Innovation Scholars Program). Students should also maintain a high level of involvement in extra-curricular activities. They should select and involve themselves in activities of genuine interest. Extensive involvement in a few activities ranging from music to athletics to clubs (such as the pre-medical or pre-dental club) can demonstrate and develop valued traits such as dedication, commitment, leadership, perseverance, and professionalism. However, extracurricular commitments should not be permitted to negatively influence academic performance.</p>
              <p class="body">Health professions schools are also interested in students who have demonstrated compassion and empathy through volunteer activities. Examples of volunteer activity include hospice programs, home health aid, crisis-line counseling, working with physically disabled or developmentally delayed individuals, working with abuse victims or with trouble youth.  Long periods of service involvement are preferred to brief stints in many activities. Note that some medical schools require non-medical volunteer experience, and some physician assistant programs specify that volunteer activity should be unpaid and emphasize _______.</p>
              <p class="goldhead">additional courses of interest</p>

<p class="subhead">The Physician in Clinical and Hospital Health Care</p>
<p class="body">The program occurs during the St. Olaf January term at the clinics and hospitals of the Fairview Health System in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area or at the Family Health Clinic in Willmar, Minnesota. Students at the Fairview locations are assigned in pairs to a physician in a given clinical setting who serves as their primary mentor. The students shadow their primary mentor or other designated physicians through their daily activities in pertinent clinical and hospital settings. The student experience involves exposure to primary and speciality care area settings involving all age group patients. Students may experience emergency care and will become acquainted with many providers in discussions about the field of medicine. If appropriate and possible, students will be invited to attend lectures and grand rounds that are held during the student observation period. Students are observers only; they will not participate in the delivery of medical care unless cleared to do so in an emergency. The Fairview Clinics involved are: Burnsville Ridges, Cedar Ridge, Eden Center, Hiawatha, and Lakes Regional Medical Center. Students are responsible for their own transporation to the assigned clinic site either from their home or from campus. Contact Professor Wes Pearson for further information.</p>
