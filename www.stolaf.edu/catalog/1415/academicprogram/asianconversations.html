<p class="programdescription">The goal of the Asian Conversations program is to provide students with an opportunity to incorporate an off-campus learning experience as well as language study into an extended discussion of the peoples and places that make up Asia. Offered as a sophomore-year sequence, Asian Conversations is open to all students interested in studying Asia and Asian languages. Students who are studying Chinese or Japanese language are invited to apply for this three-course sequence, which includes an Interim program in China and Japan.</p>
              <p class="programdescription">Those accepted into the Asian Conversations program embark on a series of linked courses that explore &quot;Journeys through Asia.&quot; Asian Conversations is a learning community that introduces students to some of the key texts of Asia as well as key historical, cultural, political and linguistic constructs through an integrated sequence of three courses. Over that time students pursue conversations with three different faculty members about the issues that have shaped the development of Asian societies over the centuries, ending in the spring term with contemporary Asia.</p>

connections and divisions create and sustain communities in Asia; and plan related projects
for their Interim course.  Prerequisite: CHIN 112 or JAPAN 112 or permission of instructor.

or China.  Activities and readings in this course build on the topics from ASIAN 210 and three
semesters of language study.  Students continue to explore their understanding of Asia through
ethnographic observation, interviews, and site visits.  Students develop projects and follow
a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct "Asian" culture
and society today.  Prerequisite: ASIAN 210.  Offered during Interim.</p>
