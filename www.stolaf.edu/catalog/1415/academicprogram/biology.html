              <p> <span class="programdescription">From  the molecules that are the building blocks of life to the complex  interactions between living organisms and their environments, biology  continues to fascinate the human mind. The Biology Department offers a  diverse array of courses and experiences that present fundamental  biological principles and processes within the context of being  informed, responsible, and compassionate citizens. It provides a broad  range of learning opportunities through its course offerings,  laboratories, independent study/research, internships and off-campus  study programs  at sites including South India, the desert southwest,  Australia,  Bahamas, Central and South America, and Northern Minnesota. Woven into all  learning opportunities are hands-on experiences with modern equipment that stimulate critical and independent thinking. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> For  science majors, the Biology Department offers an exciting slate of  challenging and rewarding courses. For the less science-oriented  student, it seeks to stimulate natural curiosity about how our bodies  work and how humans interact with their surroundings by providing  several courses designed primarily for non-science majors. These  courses, which satisfy the  natural sciences (SED, IST) requirements of  the general education curriculum, focus on current biological issues and general interest topics in biology. </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  ever-broadening nature of biology requires diversely-trained and  inquisitive biologists. The biology major has the dual mission of  introducing students to the information and technological tools of  various disciplines of biology while instilling the confidence to  critically assess a biological phenomenon and to design and carry out  an appropriate research program. To that end, the biology major provides the  necessary content and instrument training while students practice the  art of scientific inquiry. Opportunities for interdisciplinary work abound. Biology majors are encouraged to participate  in research with faculty, off-campus programs in biology, in  departmental seminars and social activities. </p>
        </div>
            <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/biology-major-ilos/">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>

    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> general REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> All students majoring in biology complete eight biology courses and a year of chemistry   (Chemistry 121, 123, 126; or Chemistry 125, 126; or Chemistry/Biology 125, 126).  Students in the class of 2017 and beyond will complete the current major, while students in the classes of 2015 and 2016 have the option of completing either the current major or the previous major; requirements for both majors are provided below.</p>
              <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">Major Requirements as of April 2013</span> <br />
              (open to students in the classes of  2015 and 2016; required for biology majors starting with the class of 2017)              
<p class="body">All students majoring in biology complete eight biology courses and a year of chemistry   (Chemistry 121, 123, 126; or Chemistry 125, 126; or Chemistry/Biology 125, 126). 
The eight required biology courses  include a foundation course, at least one course from each of four core categories, and at least one level III biology course. Two additional courses are elective courses.
<p class="body"><strong>Foundation Course</strong></p>
              <p class="body">The biology major begins with Biology 150:<em> Evolutionary Foundations of Biodiversity</em>. This course explores the evolutionary and genetic foundations of life's biodiversity, and establishes the laboratory and scientific communication skills upon which subsequent courses build. Students planning to major in biology should take this foundation course first; students who decide to switch to a biology major should take this foundation course at the time of deciding their major.</p>
              <p class="body"><strong>Core Categories</strong></p>
              <p class="body">Students must take one course from each of the four core categories. Please consult the course descriptions for which courses count towards each course category.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p class="body"><u>Ecology.</u> Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environments. These interactions are studied at levels of biological organization from individuals to populations, communities, ecosystems, landscapes, and the entire biosphere. Through ecology, students can better understand interconnections in the natural world, and become more aware of their role in sustaining the biodiversity and ecosystem services that benefit all life on earth.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class="body"><u>Cell Biology.</u> Cells are the basic units of life, and understanding the structure and function of cells, and how they are studied, is central to understanding modern biology. Through a course in this category, students will obtain a comprehensive overview of cellular structure and function, for example cellular compartments, macromolecular structures, and life processes such as energy and material flux, cell division, and control mechanisms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class="body"><u>Genetics.</u> Genetics examines relationships between genotype and phenotype in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms from classical and molecular perspectives. Through a course in this category, students will explore gene structure, inheritance, and expression. Through genetics, students discover the ways in which the field of genetics is interdisciplinary, research-based, and relevant to the world today.</p>
                </li>
                <li>                  <span class="body"><u>Comparative Organismal Biology.</u> Courses in this category study life at the tissue, organ system, and individual levels of organization. Students will broaden their knowledge of a group of organisms (e.g., plants) or of a universal biological phenomenon (e.g., reproduction). Courses in this category approach the content through comparisons across multiple </span>taxa. </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="body"><strong>Level III Biology Course </strong></p>
              <p class="body">Every biology  major takes at least one level III course in the department. Our level III course offerings vary greatly in topic and in type of student work, yet they all share aspects such that each student has an opportunity to experience sophisticated, independent, iterative work in biology. Students in a directed research course will practice sophistication in experimental design and practice, independence in their investigation, and iterative toubleshooting. Students in a non-laboratory investigative course will practice sophistication in evaluating the primary literature, as well as independence in assembling and synthesizing ideas from that literature. Not all level III biology courses meet this requirement. For example, Biology 394 (internships credit) does not count toward the biology major, and thus this requirement. Students should consult catalog descriptions for each level III course.</p>
              <p class="body"><strong>Elective Courses</strong></p>
              <p class="body">Students complete their biology major with two elective courses. Any biology course can count as an elective with the following exceptions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body">Only one independent study (Biology 298) and one independent research (Biology 396 or Biology 398) can count toward the major.</li>
                <li class="body">Internships (Biology 294 or 394) do not count toward the major. Biology 294 and 394 can only be taken P/N.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="body">In addition to courses designated as biology, the following courses can count as biology electives:</p>
          <ul>
                <li class="body">Chemistry 379: <em>Biochemistry I</em></li>
                <li class="body">Neuroscience 239: <em>Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience</em></li>
                <li class="body">Psychology 238: <em>Biopsychology</em></li>
                <li class="body"> other courses as approved by petition (including a rationale that clearly explains proposed course's place in the student's biology major) to the department.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="body"><strong>General Considerations for the Major</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body">No more than two level I biology courses, including Biology 150, and AP or IB credit may count toward the major.</li>
                <li class="body">Of the six courses counting toward the major that must be graded C or above, at least four must be at level II or III.</li>
                <li class="body">Students wishing to count for the major a course taken abroad or at another institution must consult with the chair for approval before taking the course.</li>
                <li class="body">While programs leading to graduate work are planned on an individual basis, most programs require students to have completed two or more quantitative courses (mathematics, statistics, or computer science), two courses in physics, and at least four courses in chemistry. Students intending to enter graduate or professional school are encouraged to consult with the biology faculty to plan a course of study appropriate for the postgraduate program. </li>
                <li class="body">Students pursuing a secondary school science education teaching license with a life science speciality should consider completing the biology major including Biology 123 or 243 as one of their electives. Additional courses are required as specified by the Education Department. Interested students should consult faculty in the Education Department.</li>
                <li class="body">All of the level II and III courses in biology have prerequisites. Please consult the course descriptions below for this information.</li>
              </ul>
<p><span class="goldhead">PREVIOUS Major Requirements</span> <span class="body">(open to students in the classes of 2015 and 2016)</span></p>
<p class="body">For students in the class of 2016 or earlier electing to complete the previous major, the eight biology courses must include: four core courses that emphasize cell/molecular  biology (Biology 125 or Chemistry/Biology 125-127), biodiversity and evolution (Biology 126),  genetics (Biology 233), and ecology (Biology 261); one course that focuses on a group of multicellular organisms (Biology 242, 247, 248, 251, 252, 266, or 275); one level III biology course; and two elective biology courses. The integrated chemistry-biology  sequence (Chemistry/Biology 125, 126, 227) may be taken in lieu of Biology 125, and Chemistry 125 and 126. Only one  independent study (Biology 298) or independent research (Biology 396 or Biology 398)  can count toward the major; internships (Biology 294 or 394) do not  count toward the major. Biology 294 and 394 can only be taken P/N. Of the six courses counting toward the major that must be graded C or above, at least four must be at level II or III.</p>
          <p> <span class="body">In addition to courses designated as biology, the following courses can count as biology electives: </span></p>
              <p class="body">          Chemistry 379:<em> Biochemistry I</em>   <br />                                   
          Exercise Science 375:<em> Physiology of Exercise </em><br />
            Neuroscience 239:<em> Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience</em>   or Psychology 238: <em>Biopsychology </em><br />
          <p><span class="body">or other courses as  approved by petition to the department. For two non-biology courses to  count, they must be from different departments or programs. No more  than three level I biology courses, including Biology 125 and 126, and Chemistry/Biology 127, may  count toward the major. Only Biology Department courses (including independent research)  may count toward the level III requirement. </span></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION </a></h5>
          <p class="body"> The  Biology Department honors a limited number of graduating majors with  distinction in biology. In early fall, eligible biology seniors may apply for distinction. Evaluation of candidates occurs in the spring semester. More information is available on  the Biology website at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/biology/distinction/">http://wp.stolaf.edu/biology/distinction/</a></p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Research  opportunities are central to the teaching mission of the Biology  Department. In addition to independent study, independent research,  and  project-based courses (Biology 298, 398, 396), each summer the Biology Department awards  several paid research positions to students interested in working with  faculty on current research projects. These ten-week positions offer excellent opportunities in both  lab and field research. Biology 291: <em>Topics - Research</em>  is a 0.25 credit opportunity for a journal club or other exploratory course offered at student request and the professor's discretion. Biology 375: <em>Advanced Supplemental Researc</em>h is a 0.25 credit course option for students completing a research project or piloting a new project.</span></p>
              <p><span class="body"> The Biology Department offers many opportunities for off-campus study. Two semester-long programs, Biology in South India (offered every fall semester) and Environmental Science in Australia (usually offered alternating  spring semesters), are of particular interest to biology students.  Other semester/summer programs are available through affiliated  institutions or programs (e.g., ACM Oak Ridge Science Semester, ACM  Tropical Field Research, Coe College Wilderness Field Station,  Denmark&rsquo;s International Studies Program).  In addition, each Interim several off-campus biology courses are  offered; see courses marked &quot;off campus&quot; or &quot;abroad&quot; in the course list below. Students  interested in off-campus biology courses should consult biology faculty or the Office of International and Off-Campus Studies.</span> </p>
              <p class="body"> Several  concentrations are offered that closely relate to the Biology  Department:  biomolecular science, environmental  studies, mathematical biology, neuroscience, and statistics. Students interested in these  concentrations should consult the descriptions in this  catalog or the program director.</p>
