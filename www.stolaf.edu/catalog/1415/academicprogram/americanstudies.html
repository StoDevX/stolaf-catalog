              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2014-15:</strong></span> <span class="faculty"> Mark Allister (English), environmental literature, American regionalism, men&rsquo;s studies</span></p>
              <p class="faculty"> <strong>Faculty, 2014-15:</strong> Michael Fitzgerald (History), African-American history, Civil War and Reconstruction, U.S. South;  Steven Hahn (History), Early American history, Native American history; Carol Holly (English), American literature, American women writers, American autobiography; Judy Kutulas (History), 20th-century American history, American women's history, media history; DeAne Lagerquist (Religion), American religions; Diane Leblanc (English, Writing Program), American literature, gender studies; Bruce Nordstrom-Loeb (Sociology/Anthropology), gender and race, gay and lesbian studies, cross-cultural perspectives;  Matthew Rohn (Art History), visual culture, 20th century art (on leave Interim and spring); Mary Titus (English), women writers, southern writers, race and American literature; Colin Wells (English), early American literature, the Beat Generation </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The American Studies Program offers St. Olaf students the opportunity to construct their own interdisciplinary courses of study themed around American society, culture, and institutions. The core work in the program provides students with the analytic and theoretic tools they need to integrate disciplinary perspectives. Students observe and analyze cultural patterns&mdash; ethnic, racial, religious&mdash;and gender differences and commonalities to consider the American identity and the impact of our society on the larger world. </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The American studies major is structured for both exploration and coherence. The level I seminar introduces  and integrates different disciplinary questions and concepts in the  study of contemporary culture. The level II seminar combines different  disciplines to study a single topic or time period. And the level III  seminar invites students to participate in a substantial  interdisciplinary research project.</p>
              <p class="body">American Studies is a major for people who want to chart their own course through the wilds of American culture. Unlike many majors, which prescribe sequences of courses for students, American Studies is fairly free-form. It allows a student who likes American art to create a concentration that reflects his interests, while permitting the student with interests in economics to incorporate those interests in her major. It lets one student create a major that focuses on fiction, and another to concentrate on the facts (and interpretations) of history.</p>
              <p class="body">It's both easy and interesting to double major in American Studies. Because of the range of options in American Studies, majoring in American Studies is also a good way to fulfill general education requirements, because the courses that count for American Studies may also count for some general education credit.            </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body">In consultation with an advisor, students construct nine-course majors that normally include American Studies 100, a level II topics course, and a level III seminar (when subjects are different, the topics course  and the seminar may be taken more than once), and six designated  disciplinary courses (with at least one course in each of three  departments). Of the nine courses, at least two must carry MCD general education credit and at least two must be at level III. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION</a> </h5>
          <p class="body"> Seniors  majors may apply for distinction in American studies. Candidates must  satisfy minimum GPA requirements (3.50 in the major),  prepare a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  by Oct. 15 of their senior year; the review occurs in April. </p>
