              <p> <span class="programdescription">Sociology  and anthropology share the belief that society and culture shape us in  powerful ways and that we can only know ourselves when we understand  our social and cultural context. Our personalities and choices reflect  who we are, but so do the groups and social institutions to which we  belong (peers, family, religion, politics, occupations). </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  grew out of efforts to understand the nature and problems of modern  industrial societies, while anthropology grew out of European and American colonial encounters with diverse world cultures. Both seek to explain the  relationships among individuals, groups, institutions, culture, and  meaning; both seek insights into the pressing personal and social  issues of our day. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Sociology  and anthropology contribute to current debates in politics, philosophy,  theology, and other areas about multiculturalism, environment, gender,  inequality, &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; development, welfare reform, globalization,  and immigration. All require clear understanding of life&rsquo;s social and cultural dimensions. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Occupations  drawing on sociological and anthropological knowledge include policy  research and planning, human resources and industrial relations, public  and international relations, law, medicine, ministry, counseling,  education, management, social work, and marketing. Both disciplines  also help prepare students for social service and justice work. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">Overview of the major</p>
              <p class="body">Humans are social and cultural beings. This means that they depend
upon each other and cooperate, forming social relationships and social
groups, which make up society. For societies to work, members must
communicate with each other, primarily through language. They must
also share beliefs, values, and meanings that are passed down from one
generation to another. These learned meaning structures make up the
culture of a group or society. Society and culture are interrelated in
very complex ways, and both sociology and cultural anthropology are
interested in this interrelationship.<br />
<br />
Sociological research includes both micro-level community studies and
macro-level national and transnational studies, using both
ethnographic or qualitative methods and quantitative methods.
Anthropological research is generally ethnographic, using qualitative
methods at the micro- or local level. Both disciplines are very
concerned with the dynamics of power, especially the ways in which
social structures create inequalities among members of the society and
how these inequalities are culturally justified. Both are also
interested in processes of social and cultural change.<br />
<br />
Sociology and cultural anthropology are closely related disciplines
that share certain theories and methodologies. Both are critical
disciplines because they are comparative, leading students to look at,
understand, and question their own societies and cultures. Majors in
sociology/anthropology explore sociological and anthropological
theories in two core courses. They design and conduct independent
research in quantitative and ethnographic methods core courses. In the
senior seminar, majors consider and critique the ethics of sociology
and anthropology and their impact on their own personal ethics and
morals in depth. They also select one course examining social
institutions, one course concentrating on a geographical area of the
world or a topical area of particular interest to them, as well as two
elective courses. Sociology/anthropology majors are highly encouraged
to apply and test their skills by studying abroad, doing an
independent study or research project, and/or completing an internship
for one or more of ther elective courses.<br />

              <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </p>
              <p> <span class="body">The  major in sociology/anthropology requires completion of at least nine  courses distributed as follows: five core courses  (Sociology/Anthropology 291, 292, 371, 373, 399) and four elective  courses, including at least one course from the area and topical groups  (230s, 240s) and one from the social structures and processes group  (260s). Majors are also required to take Statistics 110. Statistics 110 must be taken before   Sociology/Anthropology 371. Students are permitted to take one of the four elective courses, but not a core course, S/U. An introductory course is not required but may be used as an elective for the major. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Students  who study abroad on a St. Olaf program that includes a sociology or  anthropology course may petition to have this course count as an elective toward their  major. One independent study/research course or an off-campus field  internship supervised by department faculty may also count as an elective toward the  major. </p>

through the ways they conceptualize experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do
what they need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe and compare cultures and societies,
focusing on different aspects such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion and
values, economy and technology, cultural and social change.  This course is open to first-year
students or students in certain accredited programs.  Offered each semester.  Counts toward
