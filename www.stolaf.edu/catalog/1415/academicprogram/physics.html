              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2014-15:</strong></span> <span class="faculty">Brian Borovsky, surface physics and friction</span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2014-15:</strong>   Jay Demas, biological physics; Jason Engbrecht, positron physics and robotics;  Robert Jacobel, geophysics, ice and climate interactions; Amy Kolan, mathematical physics, statistical mechanics;  Amy Larsen, condensed matter physics</span>; <span class="faculty">David Nitz, atomic physics (on leave); Jay Tasson, fundamental symmetries; Matt Wiebold, plasma physics</span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Physics  is the study of how and why things work &mdash; from the minute world of the  atomic nucleus to the universe itself &mdash; within the context of a few  fundamental laws. The goal of the physics curriculum is to acquaint  students with basic natural phenomena and with the quantitative methods of experimentation and theoretical analysis through which we come to understand  them. It provides an excellent preparation for students planning a  technical career in physics, engineering, astronomy or related  interdisciplinary programs (biophysics, geophysics,  materials science, chemical physics, etc.). In addition, physics  supports the background training of biologists, chemists,  environmental scientists, and computer scientists.  Undertaking a liberal arts physics program enables students to become  technically literate scientists who have a broad understanding of the world and can communicate well. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">overview of the major</h5>
              <p class="body">For most students the physics major begins in the fall of their first year with the calculus-based introductory sequence, Physics 130, 131, 232: <em>Analytical Physics I, II, III</em>, covering mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and wave phenomena. This is followed in the sophomore spring with Physics 244: <em>Modern Physics</em>, preceding more advanced studies in Physics 374: <em>Classical Mechanics</em>, Physics 375: <em>Maxwell's Equations</em>, and Physics 376: <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>  in the junior and senior years. Students may also choose from a variety of elective courses depending on their career goals. A progressive sequence of courses in mathematics is a prerequisite for the courses above, and, as a result, many physics majors complete a second major in mathematics. Laboratory work is an important part of the curriculum throughout the major, and students are also encouraged to participate in research with physics faculty and in other summer programs.</p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/physics-major-ilos/">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
              <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Prospective  physics majors should enroll in Physics 130 and a calculus course in the fall  semester of their first year, although advanced placement may be given  after consultation with the department chair. Requirements  for the physics major include Physics 130, 131, 232, 244 and 245, 374, 375 and 385, 376 and 386, and one physics elective numbered  above 120. (Note that the elective requirement is waived for students  obtaining teacher certification.) In some cases it is possible to use  the 124-125 sequence to transfer into the major;  see the chair. Calculus, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and differential equations are prerequisites for some of the required courses. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Students planning to apply for graduate study in physics are advised to take Physics 379 and to consider additional physics electives, complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis. A physics major is especially suited as preparation for graduate study in electrical engineering with the inclusion of Physics 246. </p>
        </div>
<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION </a></h5>
          <p class="body"> Students who demonstrate excellence in physics coursework and who complete and report on an additional  outside project will be considered for distinction in physics. The  project may take the form of a public presentation on research work or  a topic of current interest in physics or written work such as a  published paper or a paper submitted for Physics 398:<em> Independent  Research</em>. Other activities may be eligible;  check with the department  chair. In seeking to honor outstanding coursework in the major, faculty  members do not rely solely on grades earned, but also consider factors  such as improvement and dedication. Faculty members nominate candidates  who have met the additional project criterion and a majority vote is  taken. Students who elect the S/U grading option for a level II or  level III physics course will not be eligible for distinction in  physics. </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">To obtain certification as a teacher of physical science, a physics major must take the appropriate education  courses and some additional science courses. The Education Department  chair should be consulted for details of the available options. The  requirement for a physics elective is waived. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/cs/">computer science major</a> can be designed to emphasize computer hardware by inclusion of Physics 246. </p>
              <p class="body"> Students interested in the engineering profession may choose from two primary options. A cooperative  five-year program with either Washington University or the University  of Minnesota provides a B.A. degree from St. Olaf and a B.S. in  engineering from the university. Many students prefer instead to complete  a St. Olaf degree and then enter a master&rsquo;s degree program at an  engineering school of their choice. Such a route typically takes 1.5-2  years beyond the B.A. </p>
              <p class="body"> In  recent summers, approximately 12 research positions have been available  on campus for students interested in working with physics faculty on current  research projects. These projects are supported by both external and internal funds and provide a stipend for student physics participants. See the college's <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curi/">Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry</a> web page for descriptions of recent projects.</p>
              <p class="body"> Students  also may register during the year for 398: <em>Independent Research</em> or  apply to the <a href="http://stolaf.studioabroad.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&amp;Program_ID=10100">Oak Ridge Science Semester Program</a>.  International programs that can include course work in physics are the  British University programs at Aberdeen, Lancaster and the University of East  Anglia. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate study</p>
              <p class="body">Students planning on graduate work in physics or related areas should emphasize elective courses in the major and additional coursework in mathematics, computer science, and other sciences, depending on the field of interest. Summer research experience is also very valuable and is strongly recommended.</p>
        </div>
<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="body">Students  planning to take a single physics course should consider 112,  124,  154, or 252.
