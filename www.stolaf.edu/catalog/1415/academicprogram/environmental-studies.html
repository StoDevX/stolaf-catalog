              <p> <span class="programdescription">Environmental  studies explores the relationships between natural systems, the political issues of power, justice, liberty and equality, as well as ethics, philosophy, art, culture, and literature. The result is an all-important interdisciplinary view of environmental issues and insights into understanding environmental complexity that call one to action. Addressing environmental concerns and investigating questions of environmental significance require a comprehensive and rigorous understanding of the relationship between humans and their environment, including a sense of place. Practitioners achieve this understanding through the intersection of knowledge and expertise from the natural and social sciences, and arts and humanities, as applied to the study of the intellectual and physical connections that define humanity's role in the environment. Ultimately the program strives to contribute to an understanding of biological and physical processes, responsible policy and practice, imaginative thinking, and ethical reflection spanning local and global communities.</span></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR</h5>
              <p class="body">Environmental studies  combines the strengths of disciplinary work in contributing departments with  interdisciplinary studies, giving both broad and focused perspectives on  environmental problems, issues and solutions. The program offers a major with three tracks in which students choose to focus their work:  natural sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities. In many cases work  in these tracks overlaps with traditional departmental curricula, and students  choose to complete a second major there. Recognizing the global dimensions of numerous environmental problems and the need for learning outside of the classroom,  the program provides a number of opportunities for studies abroad and in the  field.</p>
              <p class="body">All students majoring in  environmental studies take twelve required courses including an introductory course  that emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of environmental questions and  lays the groundwork for the major.&nbsp;  A capstone senior seminar course challenges students to  integrate and apply what they have learned throughout their studies.&nbsp; Each major must participate in an approved experience  that applies basic knowledge in a setting beyond the classroom. Typically this  takes the form of an off-campus environmental studies course or program, an internship, or a research project.&nbsp; Students  wishing to count courses not specifically designated as satisfying requirements  for the major must consult the chair no later than one semester prior to  enrollment.</p>
              <p><span class="body">The department offers a  concentration in environmental studies for students wishing to complement another major with a suite of courses focused on the environment.</span> </p>

<p>This course considers a variety of topics in earth and environmental science. Beginning with
the origin of the earth and planetary system, the course examines crustal evolution and plate
tectonics, geologic resources and hazards, and the relationship of these surface phenomena to
processes occurring in the earth's interior. It concludes with a study of the oceans, the
atmosphere, the earth's climate system, and environmental change. Prerequisite: proficiency in
algebra and geometry.  Offered annually. Counts toward environmental studies major (all tracks)

<p>This interdisciplinary course uses basic concepts of environmental science to explore global
environmental issues. Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and
participants will recognize many of the themes from coverage in the media. Because
most environmental problems involve issues beyond the sciences, the class examines the
economic, political, and ethical dimensions of environmental questions and environmental
decision-making.  Offered each semester.</p>
