                <p> <span class="programdescription">The  study of religion is an integral part of the liberal arts curriculum  because religion has always been a major influence on the development  of human societies. In order to make sense of past cultural  achievements, it is important to recognize the influence of religious  symbols, beliefs, rituals, scriptural texts, and traditions. To  participate meaningfully in contemporary culture, it is equally  important to evaluate the merits of various theological beliefs and religious values. </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> All St. Olaf students take courses that orient them in a general way to the study of religion  and acquaint them with the principal elements of the Christian  tradition. The religion department also makes available a range of  courses about Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism in order to  prepare students to live in our religiously diverse world. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">overview of the major </p>
                <p class="body">Since  the study of religion involves the use of a variety of methodologies  and intersects with many other fields of study, students often find  that a major in religion helps them integrate their work in other  disciplines and develop a focus for their whole liberal arts education.  Many students also choose to major in religion as a preparation for  seminary or graduate work in religion. </p>

Jesus on the cross. These two meanings have a significance for the religious and non-religious

meaning and purpose of Jesus, religious belief, reason, and the secular by reading classical and
contemporary theological work on the death of Jesus and the death of God. Prerequisite: BTS-B.
