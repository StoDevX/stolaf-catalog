          <p class="programdescription">   The Race and Ethnic Studies program is committed to the study of people of color, primarily, though not exclusively, in the United States. The program proceeds from the recognition that race and ethnicity have been and continue to be crucial components within interlocking systems of oppression as well as powerful sites of resistance to social injustice. Our work focuses on the social, cultural, and historical contributions and lived experiences of African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos/as,  Middle Eastern Americans, and new immigrants of color. Immigration to the U.S. -- historical and contemporary, voluntary and involuntary -- is an experience that unites many of these communities. As such, our program touches on the cultures and nations outside of the United States from which such people are drawn; it can also include the study of racial and ethnic minorities in other nations. Globalization has brought greater urgency to the recognition that the economic, social, and political forces to which people of color are subjected are not limited to those that originate within the nations in which they reside. Thus we also attend to transnational coalitions, experiences, and phenomena relevant to people of color in the United States and elsewhere. The Race and Ethnic Studies program is  interdisciplinary, drawing upon methodologies and materials from a variety of fields in the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts.</p>
