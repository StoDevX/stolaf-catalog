                <p> <span class="programdescription">Mathematics,  as the study of patterns and order, is a creative art, a language, and  a science. The practice of mathematics combines the aesthetic appeal of  creating patterns of ideas with the utilitarian appeal of applications  of these same ideas. As the language of physical science, mathematics  is also used increasingly to model phenomena in the biological and  social sciences. Mathematical literacy is indispensable in today&rsquo;s society. As part of the Department of Mathematics,  Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS), members of the mathematics  faculty strive to help students understand natural connections among  these related but distinct disciplines. </span></p>
                <p class="programdescription"> Mathematics  at St. Olaf is interesting, exciting, accessible, and an appropriate  area of study for all students. Each year, seven to ten percent of  graduating seniors complete mathematics  majors. The department offers courses representing various mathematical  perspectives: theoretical and applied, discrete and continuous,  algebraic and geometric, and more. Our faculty also teach courses in  statistics, computer science, and mathematics education. </p>
                <p class="programdescription"> A  concentration in statistics and a major in computer science are also  available. Courses in these areas are taught by faculty from the  Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. For further information on these, consult the separate listings under <a href="statistics.html">STATISTICS</a> and <a href="comp-sci.html">COMPUTER SCIENCE</a>. </p>
                <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
                <p class="body">Students  arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized  Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent  program of study consistent with the goals of the individual student.  The courses included in a student&rsquo;s IMaP are determined after  consultation with an MSCS faculty member and approved by the department  chair. About ten courses are normally required.</p>

            <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR 
              </h5>
              </p>
            <p><span class="body">Students  arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized  Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent  program of study consistent with the goals of the individual student.  The courses included in a student&rsquo;s IMaP are determined after  consultation with an MSCS faculty member and approved by the department  chair. </span></p>
            <p class="body"> A path through the major as described by a student&rsquo;s IMaP normally includes two semesters of calculus,  one semester of linear algebra, and at least seven intermediate or  advanced mathematics courses. The intermediate courses should include  two transition courses (from among Math 242, Math 244, and Math 252)  and courses from at least three different mathematical perspectives  (computation/modeling, continuous/analytic,  discrete/combinatorial, axiomatic/algebraic). Students must take at  least two level III courses, at least one of which must be part of a  designated level II&ndash;level III sequence. </p>
                <p class="body"> An IMaP may include up to two related courses from statistics or computer science; a current listing  of such courses is available on the mathematics web page. A student may  also find a course outside of MSCS that contributes significantly to a  mathematical path of study and may petition to have the course included  in his or her IMaP. </p>
                <p class="body">Students should consult the mathematics program web page (<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/math/">wp.stolaf.edu/math</a>) for lists of courses that satisfy each perspective, lists of sequences, and other useful information. Early consultation with a mathematics faculty member about planning an appropriate IMaP is encouraged.</p>

                <p> <span class="body">Mathematical  experiences inside and outside the classroom are important parts of an  IMaP. Following are some of the many possibilities. For more  information consult the mathematics program web page or a faculty member. </span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="body"> Research: An invigorating way to explore mathematics, research opportunities exist both on and off campus. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="body"> Experiential  learning: Mathematics 390: <em>Mathematics Practicum</em>, internships,  independent studies, and other courses provide valuable  opportunities to apply mathematical knowledge beyond the classroom. </span></li>
                  <li class="body">Mathematical biology concentration: Mathematics students with an interest in biology may want to consider a concentration in this exciting field.</li>
                  <li><span class="body"> Study abroad: The IMaP&rsquo;s flexibility allows some study abroad programs to fit into a student&rsquo;s mathematics  major. Students interested in a program focused on upper-level  mathematics should consider the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="body"> Problem solving and competitions: The department organizes problem-solving activities and sponsors  student participation in regional and national competitions. St. Olaf  also periodically hosts its own  mathematics competition, the Carlson  Contests. </span></li>

                <h5 class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR mathematics teaching licensure</h5>
                <p class="body">Mathematics majors who intend to teach grades 5-12 mathematics must meet all of the normal requirements for the major while including specific courses required for State of Minnesota licensure. Their IMaPs must include the basic requirements for all majors and Mathematics 232, 244, 252, 262, and 356, and a course in statistics. In addition, students must take Education 350: <em>Teaching of Mathematics, 5-12</em> as well as several Education courses, as listed in the <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/education/">EDUCATION</a> description. Contact the mathematics licensure advisor for advice for planning mathematics and education course sequences.</p>
                <h5 class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY </h5>
                <p class="body"> Students  planning graduate work in the mathematical sciences should pursue  opportunities that add both depth and breadth to their majors. Courses  across a broad range of the curriculum will help students prepare for the Graduate Record Exam subject test in mathematics. Fifty percent of the GRE subject test includes topics from single and multivariable calculus, and differential equations; 25% of the test includes topics from linear and abstract algebra, and elementary number theory; and 25% of the test includes topics from real analysis, topology, combinatorics, complex analysis, probability, statistics, and more. Taking many level III courses will help students prepare  for graduate study. Real Analysis II, Abstract Algebra II, Topology, Combinatorics, and Complex Analysis are especially recommended for students going into &quot;pure&quot; mathematics; Differential Equations II, Complex Analysis, Real Analysis II, and Applied Mathematics Seminars are especially recommended for students going into applied mathematics. Research experiences (on- or  off-campus) and independent studies will also help students assess and explore their interest in further mathematical study. Students thinking about going to graduate school should consult early on with a mathematics faculty member about planning an appropriate IMaP.</p>
