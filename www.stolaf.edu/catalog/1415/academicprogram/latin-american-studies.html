                <p class="programdescription"> Latin American studies offers an interdisciplinary structure for the systematic study of Latin America, an area that encompasses countries in North, Central, and South America as well as the Caribbean, whose distinct  geography  and  cultures are unified by elements of a common heritage. Profound geographic variations, differing economic resources, and the intermingling of multple racial, ethnic, and cultural groups have yielded complex and diverse   societies. Increasing socioeconomic contacts among  states and societies in the Americas and the growing presence of  Latinos in the United States underscore the need for U.S. citizens to deepen  their understanding of the region. </p>
<p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR AND CONCENTRATION</p>
                <p class="body">The Latin American studies program offers courses,  a Latin American studies major and a Latin American studies concentration with an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approach that contributes to the investigation of political, economic, ethnic, gender, religious, and cultural issues in Latin America. The support of perspectives and methodologies of several disciplines inspires students to seek a deeper understanding of Latin America and its complex relationships with the United States, and, for those majoring in Latin American studies, with Spain. In addition, students find opportunities for reflecting on their own culture and society. </p>

The requirements for the completion of the Latin American studies concentration consist of a minimum of five approved courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="body">    One foundational course, History 242 or Political Science 264  </li>

Foreign study opportunities in the Spanish-speaking world currently offered to St. Olaf students include: periodic Interims in Cuba (History 244: <em>Collective Memory in Revolutionary Cuba</em>), and Spain (Spanish 270: <em>Spain's Cultural and Linguistic Legacy</em>); the CIEE program in Seville, Spain; the Augsburg program in Central America (Guatemala; Costa Rica; and Nicaragua);  ACM programs in Costa Rica; HECUA programs in Ecuador; and  IES and CIEE programs in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Valpara&iacute;so, Chile. Students must secure prior approval for foreign study from the Latin American Studies director.
