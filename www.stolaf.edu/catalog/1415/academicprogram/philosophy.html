              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2014-15:</strong> Arthur Cunningham, philosophy of science, philosophy of physics, history of science, logic (on leave fall semester); Michael Fuerstein, social and political philosophy, epistemology, ethics, pragmatism, philosophy of science; Karen Gervais, biomedical ethics, ethics and health policy, philosophy of law, social and political philosophy, feminist philosophy;       Jeanine Grenberg, ethics, Kant, history of modern philosophy; Gordon Marino, Kierkegaard, existentialism, ancient Greek philosophy; Jason Marsh, applied ethics, normative ethics, epistemology, philosophy of religion; Danny Mu&ntilde;oz-Hutchinson, ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, Neoplatonism, medieval philosophy, early modern philosophy, philosophy of mind; Anthony Rudd, Kierkegaard, epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics, history of philosophy;  Edmund Santurri, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of religion, political philosophy; Corliss Swain, Hume, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, value theory</span>; <span class="faculty">Kathryn Swanson, philosophy of law, political philosophy. feminist legal theory </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  aim of the Philosophy Department is to engage students in disciplined  and imaginative thinking about philosophical issues. Philosophical  questions fall primarily into four groups: questions about the nature  of reality (metaphysics), about reasoning and inference (logic), about  knowledge (epistemology), and about values and society, including moral  values (ethics) and aesthetic values. These questions, which arise  naturally in the course of a liberal education, are not only  fascinating in their own right, they also touch on issues central to  understanding and improving human life in our own society and in the  world. Because they involve complex and controversial issues, there are  no easy answers. Yet it matters greatly which answers are accepted, and  it is therefore important to engage in discussion with others who face  these questions and to seek to learn from the philosophers of the past  and present. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Engaging  in philosophy develops skills in careful and fair-minded  interpretation, creative but rigorous argumentation, and perceptive,  wise evaluation of complex issues. These valuable  abilities are applicable to any subject matter and in any human context  and are useful for negotiating the ambiguities of today&rsquo;s career paths. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students  can find philosophy courses that satisfy each of the six categories of  core general education requirements. Also, a significant number of the  courses that satisfy the EIN requirement are taught by philosophers. On the department&rsquo;s  Web site, the department provides for each term a prospectus that  describes the special focus  for  each course and section. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">A  major in philosophy is highly recommended not only for those who wish  to pursue graduate study in philosophy but also as preparation for  other careers that require the ability to think in a creative and disciplined  manner about questions that are new or whose method of solution is  debated, including careers in law, theology, business, management,  medicine, journalism, politics, and education. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Philosophy majors are encouraged to participate in the student-run Philosophy Forum, to attend special lectures and events sponsored by the department, to explore study abroad programs, and to participate in departmental social events. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/philosophy-major-ilos/">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
              <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">A  major in philosophy may be attained by completing the requirements for  either a regular major or a contract major. Most philosophy courses  simultaneously count toward the major and toward one or more general  education requirements. Because the philosophy major can be tailored to  the needs and goals of individual students, all philosophy majors are  encouraged to work closely with an advisor in the philosophy department. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> A regular major requires at least nine courses in philosophy, including Philosophy 235:<em> Ancient Western Philosophy,</em>  Philosophy 236: <em>History of Modern Philosophy</em>, Philosophy 240: <em>Formal  Logic</em>, and three level III seminar courses. Level III seminar courses may not be taken S/U. These specifications seek  to first assure a major&rsquo;s grasp of the history and methods of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical inquiry. </p>
              <p class="body"> A contract major involves a contract drawn up between the student and the Department of Philosophy.  The contract combines seven courses in philosophy, including Philosophy  235 and 236, two level III seminar courses, and either  Philosophy 240 or a non-credit-bearing logic project, with three level II or III courses in another  department chosen to complement the work in philosophy. The two level III seminar courses in Philosophy may not be taken S/U.</p>
              <p class="body"><strong>Policy Concerning Philosophy 398: Independent Research (IR) </strong>(Adopted 2/12/08)</p>
              <p class="body">In special circumstances, an IR course may be substituted for a level III seminar. The circumstances are as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="body">1) the IR must have a special relevance to the student's program of study in the major or contract major, serving as a capstone experience;</p>
                <p class="body">2) by November 1 of the senior year, the student must present a petition to the chair of the philosophy department before registering for spring courses. The petition should include a rationale explaining the special relevance of the project to his or her major. The chair has full authority to grant or decline the petition;</p>
                <p class="body">3) no more than one IR course, which must be taken graded, can be used to fulfill the requirement; the other level III course(s) must be seminar courses.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="body"> These  requirements give students a great deal of leeway to pursue their own  interests. Those who wish to develop a balanced understanding of  philosophy should take a number of courses in each of the following categories: I. history of philosophy (118, 233, 235, 236, 374, Asian Studies/Philosophy 251); II. metaphysics and epistemology (231, 240, 241, 244, 371, 372); and III. ethics and value theory (119,  120, 147,  243, 245, 250, 252, 254, 256, 257, 261, 373). Categories  for 375 and 399 vary year by year. It is also possible to specialize in one of these areas, but students are strongly encouraged to take at least one, and preferably two, courses in each of the areas outside their specialization. </p>
              <p class="body"> Students who complete the Great Conversation receive credit for one elective philosophy course toward the major. </p>
            </div>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION</a> </h5>
          <p class="body"> Departmental distinction in philosophy is awarded by a vote of the department to those graduating students  whose discourse, both oral and written, exhibits such  philosophical virtues as clarity, coherence, and sensitivity to  the full range of relevant considerations, fair-mindedness, rigor, and creativity. Candidates submit a portfolio of papers by April 15 to the department chair. Additional information about applying for distinction is available on the department&rsquo;s website.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL RESOURCES </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">The  Howard and Edna Hong Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf is an  internationally-acclaimed center for the study of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard,  the 19th-century Danish philosopher who is widely recognized as the  father of existentialism. Every year, researchers from around the world come to the library to participate in its visiting fellows program.  It is an invaluable resource for students, too. A number of  philosophy students have worked in the library, and seniors and recent  undergraduates have participated in the library's  fellowship program for young scholars. The library  also sponsors <em>The Reed</em>, an undergraduate journal of existential thought. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> The  Eunice Belgum Memorial Lectures are delivered annually by leading  philosophers from around the world. Recent lecturers include   Julia Annas,  Barbara Herman, Elliot Sober,  Thomas Carson, Rachel Cohon,  Lynne Baker,  and Dan Robinson. Eleanor Stumpf is scheduled for 2014-15.</p>

our mortality affect our living? Classical and contemporary writings -- philosophical and
autobiographical -- are used. Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-231"></a>231 Philosophy of Mind</p>
<p>Is there anything about the human mind that cannot in principle be understood scientifically?  Are
we just complex physical machines?  This course looks at recent attempts to answer such questions.
Students examine the philosophical foundations of various approaches to the study of the mind and
consider the possible moral and social implications of these approaches with respect to questions
of free will, personal identity, and our responsibility for our actions.  Offered annually. Counts

philosophy or consent of instructor.  Offered annually.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-240"></a>240 Formal Logic</p>
<p>Formal systems of logic attempt to make principles of good reasoning explicit.  This course
introduces two such systems of logic: propositional and predicate calculus.  Students learn to
use formal techniques to analyze arguments and explore philosophical issues related to meta-
theory, including consistency and completeness, the paradoxes of material implication,
ontological commitment, and the interpretation of quantifiers.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-241"></a>241 Philosophical Theology</p>
<p>This course is a philosophical inquiry into the core commitments of Christian theism in the context
of other world religions and naturalism.  Central themes include beliefs about the existence and
nature of God, the doctrines of the trinity and incarnation, redemption and ritual, human free will
and responsibility, revelation and reason, religious experience, the problem of evil, different
views of life after death, miracles and historical inquiry, and religious pluralism. Prerequisite:
BTS-B. Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-243"></a>243 Aesthetics</p>
<p>A philosophical inquiry into beauty and art.  Students investigate the relationship between beauty,
goodness, and truth, and examine different accounts of art, its value, meaning, and the standards by
which it should be judged.  Themes include the nature of creativity, censorship, and the
significance -- cultural, moral, and religious -- of art. Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-244"></a>244 Philosophy of Science</p>
<p>Using examples from the natural sciences, this course examines fundamental concepts of science,
including scientific method, the nature of scientific theories and hypotheses, objectivity in data
collection and analysis, the use of technology in making observations, confirmation versus
falsification, and explanation versus prediction.  To illustrate why non-scientists need to
understand scientific practice the course also considers controversies such as global warming
and intelligent design. Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-245"></a>245 Philosophy and Feminism</p>
<p>Students examine feminist critiques of aspects of contemporary culture that shape women's
lives, such as conventional morality, science, education, art, medicine, law, religion, and
marriage.  Students critically examine philosophical views that underlie these institutions,
including views of human nature, gender, rationality, knowledge, morality, justice, and the
value of autonomy.  Alternative feminist views that promote feminist aims are explored and
evaluated. Offered most years.  Counts toward women's and gender studies major and
concentration.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-246"></a>246 Space and Time</p>
<p>An exploration of problems about the nature of space and time that are of common interest to
philosophers and scientists: Do space and time have boundaries?  Are space and time independent
of minds and bodies?  How are space and time conceived in classical vs. relativistic physics?  What
is the geometry of space?  Is time travel possible?  What is God's relation to space and time?
Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-247"></a>247 Selected Topics in Philosophy</p>
<p>Discussion of philosophical topics of general interest and concern. Topics vary from year to year,

American philosophy, and twentieth-century Continental philosophy. Offered periodically.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-250"></a>250 Biomedical Ethics</p>
<p>This course clarifies central concepts and distinctions developed in the literature of moral
philosophy and applications of those concepts and distinctions to concrete moral problems that
arise in the practice of medicine. Issues may include euthanasia, abortion, medical paternalism,
allocation of scarce medical resources, culturally sensitive medical care, pandemics, and
conflicts of loyalty in managed care. Readings are drawn from both philosophical and medical
discussions.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T or permission of instructor.  Offered annually.
Counts toward biomedical studies and neuroscience concentrations.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-251"></a>251 Science, Ethics, and Religion</p>
<p>Modern science raises important challenges for ethics and religion. Some are theoretical: can
evolutionary and cognitive science be fully accommodated by religious persons and moral
realists? Are the arguments for God's existence helped or hurt by modern science? Scientific
developments also give rise to practical challenges for ethics. Should we radically enhance
human nature? Does neuroscience show that we can't be morally responsible? Should we worry
about global catastrophes? Students explore these or related questions. Prerequisite:
completion of BTS-T or permission of instructor. Offered annually.</p>

<p class="coursename">Asian Studies/Philosophy 251 Asian Philosophy</p>
<p>This course surveys the influential philosophical traditions of India and   China. Students explore the major traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism,   Jainism, Confucianism, and Taoism and consider other traditions with which they   have interacted. Where appropriate, comparisons are drawn to Western   philosophical traditions. Offered most years. </p>
<p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-252"></a>252 Ethics and the Good Life</p>
<p>This course examines the main Western ethical theories and their application to contemporary moral
concerns.  Theoretical issues may include rights, duties, virtue, hedonism, egoism, the relation
between ethics and theology, the fact-value distinction, relativism, and pluralism.  Students
discuss current topics such as global economic justice, euthanasia, the death penalty, animal
rights, censorship, racism, privacy rights versus public safety, reproductive ethics, and
environmental ethics.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T or permission of instructor.  Offered
annually. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration (for students through class of 2016).</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-253"></a>253 Democracy: Rule of the Ignorant?</p>
<p>It is a platitude that democracy is a triumph of liberal civilization. Yet critics have charged that
democratic citizens are ignorant and ill equipped to understand complex policy issues. This
course explores the moral justifications for democracy in light of major objections and
investigates whether there is something genuinely virtuous about the kind of society it sustains.
Students discuss sources in political philosophy, economics, and political science. Prerequisite:
BTS-T or permission of instructor. Offered most years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-254"></a>254 Law, Politics, and Morality</p>
<p>This course considers the relationships between moral principles, law, and the practice of
governments.  Topics may include the "Just War" debate, censorship, property rights and
distributive justice, natural law, political liberalism and its critics, whether governments should
act in accordance with specific moral principles or remain neutral, the tensions between individual
rights and the good of the community, and the role of religion in public life.  Prerequisite:
completion of BTS-T or permission of instructor.  Offered most years.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-255"></a>255 Race and Social Justice</p>
<p>This course analyzes issues concerning race and social justice from the perspective of normative
ethical frameworks and various theories of value. Students investigate, interpret, and critique both
intellectual foundations and reasons for endorsement of the various approaches to studying
race and social justice. Students pay critical attention to how the black intellectual tradition
understands the meanings and moral implications of such ideas. Prerequisite: BTS-T or
