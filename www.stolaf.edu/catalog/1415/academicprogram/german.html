As the official language of Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein  as well as Germany, the world&rsquo;s second largest exporter, German is the language with  the largest number of native speakers in the European Union. It is the native  language of a significant portion of the population in northern Italy, eastern  Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, eastern France, and parts of Poland, the  Czech Republic, Russia, and Romania. It is the second-most commonly used  scientific language and the most widely spoken language in Europe. In a radius  of 1000 kilometers (625 miles), Germany lies at the center of a European  population of 300 million people, taking a decisive role in the political,  economic, and educational dynamics of the continent.</span></em></p>
              <p class="programdescription"><em>Studying  German offers students access to a culture of scientists and innovators,  philosophers and theologians, writers, artists, and composers. German is the  language of Gutenberg and Hertz, Fahrenheit and Einstein, Marx, Nietzsche, and  Freud, of Luther, Goethe,  Kafka, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Mahler. </em></p>
              <p class="programdescription"><em>The German  Department offers courses on campus and abroad in German language and culture,  including literature, history, and film for both majors and non-majors. A  pivotal component of German language study at St. Olaf is study abroad. In  keeping with a German tradition dating back to medieval times, German  universities today have opened their doors to students from around the world,  sharing their research in science and technology, their specialized training in  the fine arts, and their rich archival collections in the humanities. St. Olaf students may study for a semester or a full year at the  University of Konstanz, the Humboldt University in Berlin, or the University of Flensburg.</em></p>
              <p class="programdescription"><em>Beyond the  classroom, students may also participate in the weekly German conversation  table (</em>Stammtisch<em>), film series, and events in </em>Deutsches  Haus<em>, an honor house where St. Olaf  students live together in a German community with an exchange student from Konstanz.</em></p>
