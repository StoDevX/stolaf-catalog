      <h2 class="programname">Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI)</h2>
      <h6><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curi/">http://wp.stolaf.edu/curi/</a></h6>
      <p class="faculty"><strong>Director,  2014-15:</strong> Gregory W. Muth (Chemistry, Biomolecular Science), nucleic acid biophysics, medicinal chemistry, enzyme kinetics, site-directed mutagenesis, lipid accumulation in microalgae, STEM education and community outreach, the scholarship of teaching and learning</p>
      <p><span class="faculty"><strong>Program  Coordinator, 2014-15:</strong> Susan Carlson</span></p>
      <p class="faculty"><strong>Program  Assistant, 2014-15: </strong>Tory Borovsky </p>
      <p class="programdescription">The  St. Olaf Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI) program  provides opportunities for St. Olaf students&nbsp;of all academic  disciplines&nbsp;to gain an in-depth understanding of a particular subject  through working closely with a St. Olaf faculty member in a research setting.</p>
      <p><span class="programdescription">CURI  promotes collaborations between students and faculty during the academic year  through directed undergraduate research (DUR) and during the summer, both on  and off-campus. Throughout the experience, students learn about how research is  performed in the discipline of their choice. The program is also a good  opportunity for students to reflect and further evaluate where their skills,  interests, and values best fit with their future professional  endeavors.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="programdescription">A  student interested in applying for the CURI program must be enrolled as a St.  Olaf student and be a rising sophomore, junior, or senior. There is no GPA  requirement that must be met in order to apply for the program, but a student&rsquo;s  academic record will be considered during the selection process.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="goldhead"><strong>RESEARCH  OPPORTUNITIES AT ST. OLAF</strong></span><strong><a name="Here" id="Here"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="body">Research opportunities can be discovered in a  variety of settings; talk to faculty members about their research or current projects.&nbsp; Posters hanging in the halls display recent  projects and help students identify a professor&rsquo;s area of study.&nbsp; Besides these informal exchanges, students  have several options to explore opportunities during the academic year and in  the summer.</p>
      <p class="goldhead"><strong>Summer research</strong></p>
      <p><span class="body">Typically, students do not  earn course credit for summer research because they are paid employees of the  college.&nbsp; The remuneration also includes  housing on campus.&nbsp; A general email announcement  inviting students to apply for summer research is sent to all students early in  the second semester.&nbsp; This email directs students to a list of  descriptions of projects for which faculty are seeking student collaborators.</span></p>
      <p class="goldhead"><strong>Academic year</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="body">There are several ways in  which students can participate in undergraduate research during the academic  year.&nbsp;Students may take an Independent Research course and work on a project under the supervision of a faculty member</span>. <span class="body"> Another option is our Directed Undergraduate Research (DUR) course.&nbsp;In this course, which may be taught in any department or program, a small group of students work with a faculty member on research. These courses are listed in the class and lab schedule in the Student Information System (SIS). Students are encouraged to discuss these opportunities with associated faculty.</span></p>
      <p class="body">Finally, each spring students in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science are invited to apply to be Fellows in the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIR) for the following academic year. Eligible statistics students will have completed at least Statistics 272, while criteria for students in applied math or computer science will depend on the nature of proposed projects. More information on the CIR is available at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/cir/">wp.stolaf.edu/cir</a>.</p>
