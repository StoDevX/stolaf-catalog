          <p class="programdescription">Art, history, cultural studies, and technology come together in the interdisciplinary study of film: text meets sound and image, art meets science, economics meet aesthetics. Film studies addresses the inherently collaborative nature of a medium where directors, cinematographers, editors, actors, musicians, and set designers work together to create works of art. Films invite analysis and evaluation both as self-contained works of art, and as reflections of the historical and cultural circumstances in which they are created and consumed. </p>
          <p class="goldhead">overview of the concentration</p>
          <p class="body">The film studies concentration  equips students with basic skills of visual literacy (how to &quot;read&quot; the moving image), and the ability to understand the cultural, historical, and commercial contexts of films.</p>
          <p><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/film-studies-concentration-ilos/" class="goldhead">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE CONCENTRATION</a>          </p>
          <p class="goldhead">requirements for the concentration</p>
          <p class="body">The Film studies concentration consists of five courses, at least three at level II or III, including:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="body">(1) Film Studies 101:<em> Introduction to Film Studies.</em></p>
            <p class="body">(2) Studies in the history, theory, or cultural meaning of film. Two elective courses focus on the history, theory, or cultural expression of film within the United States or in a global context. These courses examine the production, critical evaluation, cultural history, and reception of film. Students take two courses to develop fluency with the critical and theoretical methods of the discipline (see list below).</p>
            <p class="body">(3) Practical film studies. One elective course that focuses on practical aspects of film creation or criticism. These courses emphasize modern film as professional practice, asking students to master at least one of the main creative or technical skill sets used in film-making (see list below).</p>
            <p class="body">(4) Integrative film studies. One more elective class drawn from (2) and (3) above, or an integrative film topics course approved by the program (see list below), or a contract course worked out in consultation with the program director and the instructor. This course challenges students to synthesize their previous study of film in ways consistent with their own needs and interests, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of film studies. Students must present to the program director a brief explanation of how their work in this course synthesizes previous interests.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="body">Note: no more than one course from another institution may count toward the concentration.          </p>
          <p class="body"><p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-101"></a>101 Introduction to Film Studies</p>
<p>This course provides an overview of film studies by focusing on three areas: history of film,
production (the basic tools of film-making), and theory (the basic vocabulary of film analysis).
Students develop visual literacy through engagement with the primary structures, methods,
practitioners, history, ideas, and vocabularies of film studies.</p>

          <p class="body"><p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-201"></a>201 American Film History</p>
<p>This course explores both classic and contemporary Hollywood cinema in its artistic, cultural,
technological, and economic contexts. Students study films ranging from silent movie classics,
screwball comedy, film noir, and the Hollywood musical through the work of Scorsese, Coppola,
and Spielberg. In addition to assigned reading and writing, students are required to watch two
films per week, one of them at a formal screening on Monday evenings. Offered periodically.
Counts towards American studies major.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-215"></a>215 American Film Realism</p>
<p>This course uses genre criticism and film theory to introduce students to the history of cinematic
realism and to examine the works of contemporary American filmmakers who have returned to
realism in an era dominated by special effects and computer generated images. Students learn
about the historical antecedents of present-day realism, including neorealism, cinema vérité, and
1970s American independent film; they then explore the work of contemporary filmmakers such as
David Greene, Sofia Coppola, and Kelly Reichardt. Offered occasionally.</p>

<p class="body"><p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-225"></a>225 Documentary Film: The Challenge of Representing Reality</p>
<p>This course explores the relevance and influence of documentary films by closely examining
their aesthetic concerns, ethical implications, and real-world impacts. The course offers a
condensed historical overview along with an examination of recent works. It combines screenings,
readings, and discussions with the goal of preparing students both to understand and to analyze
documentary films. This course does not have a production component. Prerequisite: FILM 101
or permission of the instructor. Offered alternate years.</p>
		  
<p class="coursename">294 Internship</p>
<p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>
<p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-310"></a>310 Filmmakers/Film Theorists</p>
<p>What is the relationship between film criticism and fimmaking? How is analysis a critical practice
that informs the art and craft of filmmaking? In Filmmakers/Film Theorists we will consider these
questions by focusing on film artists who also write film criticism or theory. Some case studies
that may be explored include: the American, Soviet, and French avant-garde; the European New
Waves; the Dogme '95 collective; and filmmakers Pier Paolo Pasolini, Agnes Varda, and
Robert Bresson. Prerequisite: FILM 101 or permission of instructor. Not offered 2013-14.</p>

<p><span class="coursename">394 Internship</span></p>
<p><p class="coursename"><a name="film-studies-396"></a>396 Directed Undergraduate Research: "Topic Description"</p>
<p>This course provides a comprehensive research opportunity, including an introduction to relevant
background material, technical instruction, identification of a meaningful project, and data
collection.  The topic is determined by the faculty member in charge of the course and may
relate to his/her research interests.  Prerequisite: determined by individual instructor.  Offered
based on department decision. May be offered as a 1.00 credit course or .50 credit course.</p>
