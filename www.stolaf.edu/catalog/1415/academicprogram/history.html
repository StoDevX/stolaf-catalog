              <p> <span class="programdescription">History  explores the many facets of the human condition from the past to the  present. History invites those who study it to develop an appreciation  for the variety of human experiences. Demonstrating how the past shapes  the present, the study of history also encourages an understanding  of different world cultures, societies, and outlooks on their own  terms. Students learn to analyze and to think critically about a broad  range of issues and experiences. They also learn how to develop  reasoned arguments and explanations from historical evidence. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Among  St. Olaf departments, the History Department is distinctive in the  variety of courses it offers for the college&rsquo;s interdisciplinary  programs. These courses are described here, and they are also listed in  such program descriptions as American studies, Asian studies, environmental  studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. In addition, history courses fulfill  several different general education requirements, according to subject  matter. The department is a major provider of HWC, MCG, MCD, and  WRI courses. Some history courses count toward ALS-L,  HBS, and ORC.</p>
              <p class="programdescription">The habits of critical inquiry and the deep appreciation for the  varieties of human experience across time and space that are developed in  studying history provide the basis for a wide range of professional and  personal vocations.&nbsp; History majors are  prepared for graduate and professional programs in history, law, museum  studies, public health, and various cultural or area studies, and for  developing careers in such diverse fields as education, business, ministry,  government, and journalism.</p>
              </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">St. Olaf&rsquo;s history offerings are structured to help students achieve different learning goals at different levels. In level I seminars, students approach history as a way of learning, through the critical reading of primary sources on specific historical topics. In level I foundational surveys, they explore the broad historical  development of the world&rsquo;s major societies and cultures. In other level  II surveys, students examine more specialized national, area, and  topical developments. In level II major seminars, students develop  their skills of analysis, interpretation, argumentation, and  expression. Finally, level III seminars challenge students to recognize  historical problems and to formulate their own questions about major  historical issues, and engage  ongoing debates among historians. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> History courses at level I do not have prerequisites. Level I seminars are  open only to first-year students;  level I foundational surveys are open to all students. History courses at  level II generally do not have prerequisites either, since many of them  count for general education credit. The major seminars at level II are  especially designed for history majors, although other students may  enroll as space permits. Level III courses generally require  significant prior preparation; students with little or no background in  the relevant area or period should consult with the instructor before  registration. </p>
        </div>
            <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/history-major-ilos/">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
        <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> History  majors are required to take nine courses, including one level II major  seminar and three courses at level III. No specific level I coursework is required for the major, but students may count up to three level I courses (but no  more than two seminars)  toward the major. Students must take  at least one course in each of three general areas, i.e., Europe,  United States, and the non-Western  world (Africa, Asia, Latin America). This area requirement should be  fulfilled in level I or level II courses. At least two courses in the  major must deal with the pre-modern period; see the departmental  website or the History Department chair for the approved list of  pre-modern courses. Other courses may meet this requirement if approved  by the department chair. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION </a></h5>
              <p class="body"> Senior  majors who seek a significant intellectual experience and who  demonstrate high achievement in historical research and writing may  apply for departmental distinction. Candidates must satisfy minimum  grade point average requirements (3.30 overall, 3.50 in the major),  prepare a paper under the direction of an advisor in the department and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  to the chair of the Distinction Committee by November 15 of their senior  year. The formal review begins in mid-March. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">The History Department supports several other programs: </span></p>
              <ol>
                <li class="body"> The  social studies education major (see <a href="social-studies-ed.html">SOCIAL STUDIES EDUCATION</a>) is appropriate for those considering a career  in  teaching history. Students in this major are able to double-major in history with careful planning. Interested students should consult with a faculty advisor in the Education Department.</li>
                <li class="body"> The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/flac/">Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC)</a> program offers students opportunities to integrate  their foreign-language skills with the study of history. Students in  specially designated history classes can use their Greek, Latin,  Spanish, French, German, Russian, or Chinese so that nothing is lost to  them in translation! </li>
                <li class="body"> History courses taken in St. Olaf off-campus programs can often be counted toward the major. Students who wish to count off-campus courses toward the major should seek approval from the department chair before beginning their programs. Some restrictions apply. </li>
                <li class="body"> Historical internships with academic content may also be accepted for major credit. </li>
                <li class="body"> The  interdisciplinary historical perspectives concentration enables  students to create a coherent group of five courses (from within and  without the History Department) about a particular era, theme, or  region of the world. See <a href="historical-perspectives.html">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES</a> for additional  information. Only students through the class of 2016 are eligible.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="goldhead">recommendations for graduate study</p>
              <p class="body">Students planning on graduate study in history should take  advantage of the flexibility of the history major to develop depth of knowledge  in a particular field, topic, or approach in order to position themselves for  more focused advanced study.&nbsp; &nbsp;Students might also consider developing a  research project beyond the requirements of a level III seminar by completing History  394:<em> Internship</em>, 397: <em>History Research Workshop</em> or 398: <em>Independent  Research</em>, participating in the Undergraduate Research Program, or completing the  Distinction process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most graduate  programs in history (including American and British history) require reading  and/or speaking proficiency in one or two relevant languages beyond  English.&nbsp;&nbsp; Participation in the optional FLAC  sections  attached to a number of history courses (see above) is an excellent  way to demonstrate both language proficiency and the capacity to apply that proficiency  to the analysis of historical evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Study abroad can also enhance preparation for graduate school.&nbsp; In recent years, History majors have been  accepted for advanced historical study at Duke University, the Universities of  Chicago, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Toronto, and Virginia;  William and Mary, and Yale University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
