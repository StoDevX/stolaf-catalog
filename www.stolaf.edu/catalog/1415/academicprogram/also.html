        <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2014-15:</strong> Renata Debska McWilliams, Director, World Languages Center</span></p>
        <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty advisory committee, 2014-15</strong></span><span class="faculty"><strong>:</strong>  Ibtesam &acirc;l-Atiyat (Sociology/Anthropology)  Arab world, gender, social movements, global interdependence, Islam; Amine Bekhechi (French) 20th-century French and Francophone literature; Sylvia Carullo (Spanish) colonial and 20th-century Spanish-American literature, Hispanic culture; Dana Gross (Associate Dean of IGS, Psychology) developmental psychology;  Karil Kucera (Asian Studies, Art and Art History),  Asian visual culture; Jamie Schillinger (Religion), Islam, ethics, theology</span></p>
<p> <span class="programdescription">The Alternative Language Study Option (ALSO) is a pilot program that offers students the opportunity to study languages outside the traditional language curriculum currently offered at St. Olaf. In 2014-15, Beginning and Intermediate Arabic, Beginning Korean, and Beginning Italian will be offered. </span></p>
        <p class="programdescription">The program is administered as an independent study program through the faculty for Interdisciplinary and General Studies and supervised by the World Languages Center (WLC) director. The WLC offers the necessary space, technology, and instructional materials for language study to be pursued. Any courses taken under the ALSO option cannot be used to fulfill the foreign language general education requirement at St. Olaf; rather, they are intended to serve as a supplementary option for language study.</p>
        <p class="programdescription">All language sessions take place in the WLC Resource Room, TOH 153. In each session, students work with a native-speaker language learning facilitator to practice reading, writing, and general language content, including grammar. Outside of these class sessions, students work on  assignments to continue learning content that is then practiced in class. Students are also expected to attend weekly tutorial sessions with a native speaker. Throughout the semester, students complete an oral and written midterm and final exam developed by an outside examiner. Students are also expected to meet with the ALSO program director regularly to discuss their progress in the course. Grades are determined through evaluation of student work by the outside examiner and program director.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS</p>
        <p class="body">Eligibility for participation in the ALSO program is determined by previous language performance. Interested students must have successfully completed the college's foreign language (FOL) requirement within the regular St. Olaf curriculum, must demonstrate evidence of serious motivation and the ability to work independently, and must meet the 2.75 minimum GPA requirement. In addition, students are required to provide two faculty references, one of which must be a former language professor.</p>
        <p class="body"><span class="goldhead">COURSES</span></p>
        <p class="coursename">Alternative Language Study Option 100, 101, 200 Arabic; 102, 103 Korean; 104, 105 Italian
        <p class="body">Students learn a language such as Arabic,  Korean or Italian in a guided, independent study program offered through the World Languages Center. They meet with a native speaker facilitator for three hours a week, in addition to ten hours of study on their own and mandatory tutorial sessions. Syllabi and tests are developed and administered in consultation with an expert outside examiner. Students in this program are strongly encouraged to take courses in the general curriculum that provide important cultural context for the study of their language. The language(s) offered in any semester depend(s) on student interest, usually requiring 2-5 students to offer a section. Prerequisite: Prior completion of FOL requirement.
