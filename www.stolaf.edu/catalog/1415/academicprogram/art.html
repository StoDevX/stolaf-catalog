        <p class="programdescription">The Department of Art and Art History at St. Olaf approaches the study   of art as an intellectual and creative endeavor. The department's   curriculum provides students with the research, interpretive, and   technical skills to make and study meaningful works of art and to   sustain them as artists and critical thinkers throughout their lives. In   keeping with the larger mission of St. Olaf, art and art history   faculty strive to teach students to make connections between cultures   and across academic disciplines, and to work creatively with a broad   range of media and critical models. The Flaten Art Museum is integral to   the curriculum with its on-going exhibition program and its permanent   collection. Through the resources provided by the studio, classroom, and   museum, art and art history students learn to question, investigate, and   explore art in order to gain an understanding of its transformative   power in the world and in their own lives.</p>
