            <h2 class="programname"> English </h2>
<h6><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/english/">http://wp.stolaf.edu/english/</a></h6>
        <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2014-15, Fall and Interim: </strong>Colin Wells, 18th-century British and American literature</span></p>
        <p class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2014-15, Spring:</strong> Mary Titus, American literature, American studies</p>
        <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2014-15:</strong> Mark Allister, American literature, environmental literature, American studies;    Karen Cherewatuk, Anglo Saxon, medieval literature; Jennifer Kwon Dobbs, creative writing (on leave);  Carlos Gallego, 20th-century American literature, Chicano/Chicana literature; Joan Hepburn, African American literature, drama (on leave fall semester);    Carol Holly, American literature;  Karen Marsalek, medieval literature and linguistics, Renaissance drama; Joseph Mbele, post-Colonial literature;   Linda Mokdad, film studies; Jonathan Naito, 20th-century British and Post-colonial literature; Bj&ouml;rn Nordfj&ouml;rd, film studies; Juliet Patterson, creative writing; Benjamin Percy, creative writing; Thomas Pope, screenwriting; Diana Postlethwaite, 19th-century British literature, literature and film; Rebecca Richards, writing, rhetoric, composition, and the teaching of English; Kaethe Schwehn, creative writing; Mary Trull, 16th- and 17th-century literature</span></p>
        <p> <span class="programdescription">Literature  is one of the most compelling ways in which humans have recorded and  reflected on their lives, imagined different worlds, and communicated  one with another. It offers the pleasures of artistic  expression combined with the rewards of empathy and  insight, knowledge and inspiration. </span></p>
        <p class="programdescription"> Drawing on 1500 years of literature from Geoffrey Chaucer and John Milton to Emily Dickinson, Chinua Achebe and Toni Morrison, the English major encourages students to dig deeply and to range widely, crossing borders and exploring diversity both in content (authors, literary genres, and historical periods) and in form (critical and creative approaches).</p>
        <p class="programdescription">Students are exposed to a variety of conceptual approaches to literary study. The traditional methodologies of literary history and genre studies remain. But students also learn the cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural methods that are redefining literary canons and strongly influencing scholarship as we move into the 21st century.</p>
        <p class="programdescription">As they discuss and write about what they have read, students develop an informed understanding of the force of literary language and improve their powers of communication, analysis, and persuasion. In the department's creative writing courses, students can nourish their own verbal creativity while working with literary forms from the inside.</p>
        <p class="programdescription"> The  English major is easily and frequently combined with other majors, and is compatible with off-campus study. Most courses taken elsewhere can count toward the major as electives.  </p>
        <p class="programdescription"> Some English majors may be headed for graduate programs in literature; some plan to teach; some are creative writers. Others may be preparing for careers  in fields  such as publishing, law, business, or community service that reward strong communication skills. Within a framework requiring them to experience multiple approaches to literature, students have flexibility in shaping their course of study to their individual interests and aspirations.</p>
<h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
        <p class="body"> Organized around four categories (literary history, cross-cultural, cross-disciplinary, and genre), the English major requires ten courses: English 185, three level II courses in specified categories, and six electives, two of which must be from level III. Among the level II courses, one must be in literature before 1800, and one in literature after 1800. Neither an independent study, an independent research, nor English 396 can count as one of a student's two level III major reuirements.</p>
<h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
        <p class="body"> Many English courses carry general education credit in ALS-L, ORC, and WRI. Some carry HWC, MCG,  MCD,  or EIN credit. </p>
        
<h5 class="goldhead"> PREREQUISITES </h5>
        <p class="body"> FYW is a prerequisite for all other courses  in the department except specified level I courses. While a few courses have additional prerequisites, most level  I and level II courses are open to all &mdash; majors and non-majors alike &mdash;  after FYW. Level III courses (numbered 300 or higher) are primarily for  English majors and ordinarily build upon prior work. All level III  courses require as a prerequisite English 185 and at least one level II  course in an area of relevant background as confirmed by the instructor  or the department. </p>
        
<h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/english-major-ilos/">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>
        <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
        <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS </h5>
<h6> <span class="body">Requirements for the Graduation Major </span></h6>
        <p class="body"> <strong>Level I:</strong> English 185 (Literary Studies)</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Level II:</strong> 3 courses: one from cross-cultural studies, one from literary history, and one from either cross-disciplinary studies or genre.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>1800 requirement:</strong> Among all courses taken at level II (category-specific and elective), one must be in literature before 1800; one must be in literature after 1800.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Six electives</strong>, two of which must be at level III. At least one level III course must be a literature course.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong> Requirements for the Graduation Major Plus Communication Arts/Literature (CAL) Teaching Licensure</strong></p>
        <p class="body">Eight English courses: English 150, 185, 205, 242, 250, 256, one literary history course, one cross-disciplinary or genre course, and one level III literature elective. Additional requirements: FYW, Theater 100, Theater 120, Media Studies 160. Further courses required in Education Department.</p>
<h5 class="goldhead"> <a href="../academicregs/academic-honors.html#distinct">DISTINCTION </a></h5>
        <p class="body"> The  English Department awards distinction on the basis of a student&rsquo;s  overall record in the department and on the quality of a portfolio of written work -- critical, creative, or a combination of both -- submitted by the candidate in his or  her senior  year. To be a candidate for departmental distinction, a student must  have completed a minimum of seven graded  courses in the major, six of which must have been taught by St. Olaf College faculty. The combined GPA of all graded courses in the major taught by St. Olaf faculty must be 3.8 or higher. Such students may apply in the fall semester of their  senior year. Students interested in distinction should obtain  guidelines from the Department Distinction Coordinator and find a  supervisor in the English Department before applying. </p>
        
<h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
        <p class="body"> Special  programs include semester and full-year study in England at Oxford,  Lancaster, and East Anglia; study in Scotland at Aberdeen; semester and  full-year study in Ireland at Trinity College, University College  Dublin and University College Galway; Interim study in the Caribbean; semester and Interim study at the Newberry Library in  Chicago; Urban Teaching semester in Chicago; Interim theater study in  London; internships in writing. (See<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/international/"> INTERNATIONAL AND OFF-CAMPUS  STUDIES</a> for further information.) </p>
        
<h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY </h5>
        <p class="body"> Students  planning on graduate study in English should take the graduation major  and additional courses for a total not to exceed 14. Specific programs  should be planned with the student&rsquo;s academic advisor. At least two  foreign languages should be included, one of which should be French or  German. In recent years, English majors have been accepted for graduate  study in literature (at Berkeley, Chicago, Princeton, Toronto,  Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin) and in writing (at Boston  University, George Mason, Iowa, and New School University). </p>
        
<h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
        <p> <span class="body">Most level  II courses (numbered in the 200s) are open to all students (with some class-year limits) without  prerequisite beyond FYW. Level III  courses (numbered in the 300s) are primarily confined to the major,  demand control of methods and of basic factual and theoretical  knowledge appropriate to English studies, require more advanced work,  assume more preparation, and pursue subjects in greater depth than do  Level II courses. Level III courses are open to students with the  stated prerequisites. </span></p>
        <p class="body"> Courses  in writing provide the opportunity for students, whether beginning or  experienced writers, to develop their own work in a variety of modes  including poetry, journalism, creative nonfiction, drama, and fiction  for both beginning and experienced writers. </p>
        <p class="goldsubhead"> LITERARY STUDIES 
                
          </p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-201"></a>201 Transatlantic Anglophone Literature</p>
<p>This course considers Anglophone writing from Africa and the Caribbean. Linked by the slave
trade and colonization, the drive for national independence, and the challenges of globalization,

transformation, readings encompass influential works by established writers and contemporary
works by emerging voices. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-202"></a>202 Literary Representations of the Racial Subject</p>
<p>This course explores representations of racial identity in twentieth-century American literature.
Students use Enlightenment and modern theories of subjectivity (i.e., a person's sense of agency
and/or "self") to explore the ways in which racial identity functions as both a social construction
that can be mobilized for various purposes, as well as a material reality with lived consequences.
Balancing well-known with less familiar literary texts, the course examines different theories of
subjectivity and how they are challenged or reinforced when addressed through the interpretive
lens of race. Although the readings in this course focus specifically on twentieth-century American
literature, the theoretical texts are comparative and include non-American authors. Prerequisite:
FYW. Offered periodically.</p>


<p class="coursename"><a name="english-203"></a>203 Asian American Literature</p>

displacement, gender, intergenerational conflicts, sexuality, transnationalism, and U.S.
militarism. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-204"></a>204 South Asian Literature</p>
<p>Exciting writing in English is coming from South Asia: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.
An area once shaped by British colonization, South Asia is changing rapidly now with
globalization.  Students explore this area's history, culture, and religion by reading literature
that tells compelling stories about individuals and groups that seem far different and far away from
21st-century Minnesota.  Prerequisite: FYW.  Offered periodically.</p>


<p class="coursename"><a name="english-205"></a>205 American Racial and Multicultural Literatures</p>
<p>Students explore the histories, cultural patterns, religious practices, key institutions,
gender issues, narrative styles, and significant contributions to our nation of an array of
racial and multicultural groups. Such diverse writers as Leslie Silko, Chaim Potok, Amy Tan,
and Toni Morrison raise questions about voice and identity, both individual and collective.
Prerequisite: FYW.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-206"></a>206 African Literature</p>
<p>Students explore African literature as it has evolved from oral traditions like folktales and epics

communal identities, class considerations--all of these and more images and themes arise in the
fictional readings required for this course. Students read such writers as Mariama Ba, Gordimer,
Hurston, and Naylor. Ticket/transportation fee required. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered
occasionally in Interim.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-208"></a>208 Black and Asian British Literatures</p>
<p>After the Second World War, Britain experienced a surge in immigration from the Caribbean,
South Asia, and Africa, a crucial step in the transformation of Britain into a multiracial,
multicultural nation. Over the past several decades, these immigrants and their descendants
have crafted distinct bodies of work in literature, film, music, and visual art. This course is a
broad, multi-genre introduction to their work with particular emphasis on its historical and
cultural context. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically.</p>
<p class="coursename"><a name="english-210"></a>210 Post-Colonial Literatures</p>

Africa--by traveling where he traveled and reading his writings about those places. Readings
include Hemingway's <I>Green Hills of Africa</I>, "The Snows of Kilimanjaro," "The Short Happy
Life of Francis Macomber," and  <I>Under Kilimanjaro</I>. Through folklore and additional
readings by western and East African authors, students experience and learn about the cultures

in private homes.  Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically during Interim.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-220"></a>220 Topics in Literary History</p>
<p>These courses trace the process of literary change during a selected period of approximately
one hundred years, providing an experience of chronological breadth and textual variety.

and the heroic epic <I>Beowulf</I>. Readings from the Middle English period include lyric and
ballad, romance from the Arthurian and non-Arthurian traditions, drama, allegory, mystical
treatises, and Chaucer's <I>Canterbury Tales</I>. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-228"></a>228 Romantic/Victorian/Modern British Literature</p>
<p>This course explores British literature of three eras, from Wordsworth to Woolf. Students begin
with the romantic revolution of the late 18th century, traverse the wide 19th-century span of Queen
Victoria's reign, and cross into the modernist era following the cataclysm of World War I. Within
each era, students examine a literary manifesto, a revolutionary event, an epic poem, a novel,
and the aesthetics of the period. The course emphasizes conversations across eras and striking
moments of "making it new." Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="english-229"></a>229 Twentieth-Century British and Irish Literature</p>
<p>The 20th century was a period of great achievement in British and Irish literature, as demonstrated
by the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and Samuel Beckett. This
course examines the famously innovative work of poets, playwrights, and novelists active during
the first half of the century. It then considers postwar writing and the challenges that this
literature offered to the ideas and practices associated with modernism. Prerequisite: FYW.</p>
<p></p>

conformity, and the issues associated with gender, such as family, power dynamics, oppression,
activism, domesticity, hierarchies, and inequalities. The texts focus on a diversity of gendered
