            <p class="programname">Academic Advising at St. Olaf College</p>
            <p class="programdescription">Academic advising at St. Olaf College encourages the integration of the mind, body, and spirit as students learn to create academic, career, and lifelong goals. Students discover how to direct their intellectual curiosities, to overcome personal or academic barriers to learning, and to attain their goals. Central to this educational process is the collaboration between students and their faculty advisors. </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Advisors</p>
            <p class="body">Each student is entitled to a faculty advisor. Advisors for new students are assigned by the Academic Advising Center. The student may remain with this faculty member or change to another faculty advisor at a later date with the permission of the new faculty advisor. After completing at least one semester, all students have the right to change to a different faculty advisor at any time during the academic year. </p>
            <p>The Academic Advising Center and the department chairs and program directors oversee the reassignment of advisees for faculty on sabbaticals or other leaves. </p>
            <p>The advice of faculty advisors does not constitute a promise or a contract ensuring a student&rsquo;s graduation on schedule or the completion of specific requirements. Students and faculty advisors must refer to the <em><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">Class and Lab Schedules</a> </em>to determine which courses fulfill specific graduation requirements. The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student. Students have access to their academic records at any time on St. Olaf&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/sis">Student Information System (S.I.S</a>). </p>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Goals for Academic Advising            </p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Through academic advising, students at St. Olaf College will:</strong>             
            </strong>            </p>

              <li>learn to utilize resources on the St. Olaf campus;</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="goldsubhead">Students' roles and responsiblities            </p>
            <p class="body"><u>It is important to know that the responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student. </u></p>
            <p><strong>In order to take full advantage of the wide range of academic opportunities at St. Olaf College, students are expected to:</strong>             </strong>            </p>

A major MUST be declared in person at the registrar's office by fall semester of a student's junior year; however, students are strongly encouraged to declare a major as soon as possible. In addition to a major, students may choose to declare an <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/catalog/academiclife/majors-and-more.html">area of emphasis or a concentration</a>;</li>
              <li>consider how to incorporate <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/catalog/international/">off-campus study</a> into a long range plan;</li>
