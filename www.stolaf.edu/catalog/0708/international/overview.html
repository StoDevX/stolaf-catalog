            <p class="programname">International
                and 
              Domestic Off-Campus Studies: Global Perspective </p>
            <p class="body"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/international/">http://www.stolaf.edu/international/</a> </p>
            <p class="body">&ldquo;Global Perspective&rdquo; &mdash; The
                term comes up again and again when St. Olaf students and faculty
                talk about the lessons they have learned while studying on international
            and domestic off-campus programs. </p>
            <p class="body"> They&rsquo;re talking about the kind of exciting
                insights they received when Hindu caste systems, Scandinavian
                cinema or Greek architecture came to life before their eyes;
                when their biology or physics laboratory moved to a rain forest,
                a desert or a glacier; or, when everyday and utterly familiar
                things like eating breakfast or taking a bath were put into thought-provoking
              new contexts. </p>
            <p class="body"> The objective of all off-campus programs is
                to provide students with the opportunity to engage in cross-cultural
                learning. Students gain knowledge and awareness of cultures other
                than their own and reflect on their own culture with a new perspective.
                Around three-fourths of all St. Olaf students participate
                in off-campus programs, many of them led by St. Olaf faculty
                members. As a matter of fact, more than 70 percent of every graduating
                class have studied internationally, in places as diverse as Aberdeen,
                Chiang Mai, Harare and Medan. Around 16 percent have participated
                in domestic programs &mdash; ranging
              from Interim courses on desert biology to consortial programs in
              urban education, the contemporary art scene and northwoods environmental
            literature. </p>
            <p class="body"> A number of students find off-campus study
                so valuable that they participate in two or three programs during
                their St. Olaf careers. Of equal importance is the fact that
                faculty members find these programs extremely rewarding &mdash; both for their students and
              for themselves. That is why, in the more than 40 years that St.
              Olaf has been sponsoring them, the college&rsquo;s field-supervised
              programs (Term in the Middle East, Term in Asia, Global Semester,
              and more recently, Environmental Science in Australia) have been
              led by more than 50 different professors, and 140 faculty members
            have led more than 300 off-campus Interim courses. </p>
            <p class="body"> Each off-campus offering has a program adviser. Program advisers
                are St. Olaf faculty members who are particularly well qualified
            to offer academic advice on specific programs. </p>
            <p class="body"> It is strongly recommended that all first-year students discuss
                off-campus study plans with their academic adviser and with the
                faculty program adviser or the study abroad adviser in the International
              and Off-Campus Studies Office.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Consortial Activities </p>
            <p class="body"> Exchange agreements and the college&rsquo;s
                membership in consortia make it possible for students to participate
                in a number of exciting off-campus programs in addition to the
            ones sponsored by St. Olaf itself. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is one of 14 liberal arts colleges that make up the
              Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM). Other ACM members are
              Beloit, Carleton, Coe, College of the University of Chicago, Colorado,
              Cornell, Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Macalester, Monmouth
              and Ripon. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is also a member of the Higher Education Consortium
              for Urban Affairs (HECUA), which offers students specialized programs
                in domestic and international sites focusing on community issues
                and social change.<br />
        </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Policies and Procedures </p>
            <p class="body"> Students are responsible for adhering to the
                regulations and policies contained in the Academic Regulations
                section of this catalog. In particular, students on St. Olaf
                off-campus programs are directed to refer to the policies on &ldquo;Graded and Ungraded Courses&rdquo; for
                full details on how off-campus programs affect this graduation
                requirement.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Qualifications </p>
            <p class="body"> Nearly all St. Olaf students who study off
                campus do so during their sophomore, junior or senior years.
                (A few Interims are open to first-year students.) The college&rsquo;s
                4-1-4 calendar (two semesters separated by an Interim in January)
                contributes to the flexibility: it enables students to participate
                in programs that last a month, a summer, a semester, half a
            year or a full year. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students intending to take part in a recognized program off-campus
              must be in good academic standing, be sufficiently mature to benefit
              from such study and provide evidence of good health. Many programs
              have prerequisites, including introductory or advanced courses
              in a specific discipline or certain levels of language proficiency.
              Some programs are competitive and applicants will be accepted based
              on meeting a standard set of criteria governing the selection process.
              Details about all St. Olaf-approved semester and year-long programs,
              program advisers, prerequisites and application deadlines and procedures
              are found in the international and off-campus program brochure,
              published every fall by the Office of International and Off-Campus
              Studies. Interim offerings are detailed in the off-campus Interim
              brochure published each spring by the Office of International and
              Off-Campus Studies. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Fees </p>
            <p class="body"> Students in all St. Olaf-sponsored programs pay the St. Olaf
              tuition plus a program fee. In addition, students are expected
              to cover passport fees, the costs of additional independent travel
              and personal expenses. St. Olaf financial aid is available for
              St. Olaf off-campus programs. Information about special scholarships
                  for off-campus study is available from the Financial Aid Office
                  or the study abroad adviser in the International and Off-Campus
                  Studies Office. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Grades, Credits, Registration </p>
            <p class="body"> All off-campus courses are graded and appear
                on the transcript, but only those letter grades given for a course
                taught by a St. Olaf faculty member are calculated into a student&rsquo;s
            grade point average. </p>
            <p class="body"> In order for a student to receive academic credit for off-campus
              study sponsored by an institution with which St. Olaf has a program
              relationship, registration must be done in advance through St.
              Olaf College. </p>
            <p class="body"> All credits earned on St. Olaf-approved programs are viewed as
                  resident credit. In most cases, students can expect to earn
              the same amount of credit on an off-campus program that they would
                earn on campus during a comparable period of time. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students studying on St. Olaf off-campus programs
                should be aware of the &ldquo;24 graded courses&rdquo; graduation
                requirement. Full details on how this requirement is affected
                by off-campus courses is found in the Academic Regulations section
              of this catalog.</p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf&rsquo;s S/U policy applies to courses
              taken on off-campus programs. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Credits for Non-St. Olaf Terms Off-Campus </p>
            <p class="body"> Students wishing to study on programs not listed in the St. Olaf international and off-campus program brochure must take
                  a leave of absence from the college and must negotiate in advance
                  with the registrar in order to be sure that credits will transfer.
                  Students may earn elective credit and credit toward a major,
                  but may not fulfill general education requirements through
              such programs. These students may not register for subsequent St.
                  Olaf terms through a proxy.<br />
        </p>
            <p class="goldhead">St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus Study Opportunities</p>
            <p class="body"> Full details about programs, program advisers,
                prerequisites and application deadlines and procedures are found
                in the international and off-campus program brochures, published
                every fall and spring by the Office of International and Off-Campus
                Studies. The brief descriptions located in this catalog, however,
              will give you an idea of the breadth and depth of St. Olaf&rsquo;s
              off-campus study opportunities.</p>
