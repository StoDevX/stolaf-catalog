            <p class="programname">Pre-Professional Preparation</p>
            <p><em>The following roster of pre-professional studies indicates how the liberal arts can fulfill the general as well as the specialized objectives of St. Olaf students. Recommendations are based on the typical pre-professional requirements currently existing in universities and professional schools. </em></p>
            <p><em>Many other occupations beyond those in this roster may be pursued with a liberal arts background, of course. To learn more about them, call or visit the campus contact persons listed in areas that seem similar. </em></p>
            <p><em>Subjects grouped under the headings &ldquo;Strongly Recommended&rdquo; are required by many institutions while those under &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; are important but not necessarily required. Because of their diverse nature, many professions such as business and management, law, and public policy defy course-specific recommendations for undergraduates. For example, as many psychology as economics majors in the United States enter business careers each year through corporate training programs. In those instances, recommendations should be considered sug-gestive, not directive. Opposite examples are nursing and social work (consult the Index), which have prescribed curriculums required for licensure examinations. </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">PRE-PROFESSIONAL STUDIES</p>
            <p class="body">Students are encouraged to work closely with faculty, pre-professional advisors, department chairs, and the Center for Experiential Learning during and after their time at St. Olaf. </p>

            <p class="body"><b>Campus contact person:</b> Mary Emery, Economics Department</p>
            <p class="body">Students planning to sit for the CPA examination upon graduation should major in economics or mathematics and take elective courses in accounting and finance. Since 2000, new members of the American Institute of CPAs have been required to earn one year of college credit beyond the bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students are strongly advised to check the regulations for licensure in the state where they intend to practice. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> Management Studies 225, 237, 250, 251, 252, 281, and 380; Mathematics 126 </p>

            <p>Students planning to enter the business world immediately upon graduation and seek a career in accounting, finance, management, or marketing should major in economics and consider an area of emphasis or a management studies concentration. </p>
            <p><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> Management Studies 225, 237, 250, 251, 252, 256, 257, 383; Psychology 125 </p>

            <p class="body">Most students choose to complete a B.A. degree at St. Olaf before beginning work on an M.S.E. degree at the school of their choice, an option which typically takes five and one-half to six years.
