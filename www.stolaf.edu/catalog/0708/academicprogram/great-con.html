              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2007-08:</strong> Edmund N. Santurri (Religion and Philosophy), ethics, theology, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, aesthetics, religion and art </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Kathryn Ananda-Owens (Music) piano; David Booth (Religion), theology; Christopher M. Brunelle (Classics), Latin poetry, classical languages and literature; Laurel Carrington (History), medieval, Renaissance and Reformation; Doug Casson (Political Science), political theory, American constitutional law;  Elizabeth Galbraith (Religion), theology;  Gary Gisselman (Theatre),  acting, directing;  Vicki Lynn Harper (Philosophy), ancient Greek philosophy, logic, ethics; Edward Langerak (Philosophy), ethics, Kant, social and political philosophy; Karen Marselek (English), medieval literature and linguistics;   Anne G.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">An integrated sequence of five courses taken over two years, the Great Conversation introduces students to the major epochs of Western tradition through direct encounter with significant works. Beginning with the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, the program traces the development  of literary and artistic expression, philosophic thought, religious  belief, and historical reflections on Western culture into the modern  world. Students respond to great works, challenging  the ideas expressed in them and challenging their own ideas as well,  thus joining the conversation of men and women through the ages about  the perennial issues of human life. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Great Conversation is open to students of all interests. This program  appeals to those who like to read, discuss, and write about ideas;  those who believe that learning about the past is profoundly relevant  to understanding the present; those who want to examine the Western  tradition in a unified way; and those who believe that an education  ought to cultivate discriminating minds, inquisitive spirits, and moral sensitivity. </p>
              <p><span class="programdescription"> The  faculty members who teach a Great Conversation cohort remain with the  students through the courses in the standard sequence (113-218), as  fellow participants in the conversation. Besides living in the same residence hall their first year, students in the Great Conversation enjoy eating meals together, attending films and theater, and going on field trips.</span> </p>

            <div>

Selection is based  on an essay describing the reasons for the student&rsquo;s interest in the  program. Great Conversation brochures and application forms are sent to  students after they are admitted to St. Olaf. </p>

widely considered the culmination of the best education. In this course, students visit
archaeological sites and museums in Greece and Italy and study the works of art and architecture

employed to frame discussion, study, and reflection on the roles of the Great Conversation and
