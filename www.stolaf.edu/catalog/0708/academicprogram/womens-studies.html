              <p class="programdescription"> Women&rsquo;s  studies, an interdisciplinary program, focuses on the significance of  gender in the formation of knowledge and human experience. Majors and  concentrators take a range of courses in the humanities and social and  natural sciences, as well as in the women&rsquo;s studies program. Students  explore the new scholarship about gender and gain an understanding of a  variety of women&rsquo;s experiences across cultures and throughout history.  Women&rsquo;s studies seeks to enrich our understanding of women&rsquo;s lives and  consider the conditions necessary to create a more equitable world. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  major in women&rsquo;s studies consists of nine courses: Women&rsquo;s Studies 121,  Women&rsquo;s Studies 399 (to be taken in the spring of the senior year),  plus seven additional courses, one of which must be at Level III. These  seven courses shall include at least one course from each of the  following areas: 1. Social or Natural Sciences; 2. Literature,  Languages, or the Arts; 3. Religious, Historical, or Philosophical  Traditions. No more than two courses taken elsewhere may be counted  toward the major. </p>
              <p> With  the approval of the instructor and the director of women&rsquo;s studies,  majors may apply toward their program courses not designated as  approved women&rsquo;s studies courses. Students who apply partial-credit  courses toward the major must still complete the minimum number of  required courses. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>

A concentration in women&rsquo;s studies consists  of Women&rsquo;s Studies 121 and four additional courses, three of which must  be at Level II or III, drawn from at least three departments. </p>
              <p> With  the approval of the instructor and the director of women&rsquo;s studies,  concentrators may apply toward their program courses not designated as  approved women&rsquo;s studies courses.
