              <p> <span class="programdescription">St.  Olaf College prepares teachers whose commitment to democratic ideals is  manifested in their ability to address the needs of all students; in  their dedication to schools, communities, and society; and in their  commitment to the profession. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Education Department prepares highly qualified, reflective teachers who  integrate liberal arts, their subject matter, and professional  education. Reflective teacher candidates assess their options and make  sound professional decisions based on practical, pedagogical, and  ethical criteria. Teacher candidates develop leadership skills and  contribute to the profession  and to society. St. Olaf's mission is to prepare its students to be  &ldquo;seekers of truth, leading lives of unselfish service to others.&rdquo; The  faculty members in the teacher education program share in this mission  by preparing teachers who embrace this ideal. </p>
              <p class="programdescription">Approximately 10 percent of St. Olaf graduates qualify for Minnesota teaching  licenses each year. Most graduates choose employment as educators in K-12  (kindergarten through grade 12) classrooms in the U.S. or abroad. Many  also attend graduate school in special education, counseling, or  related human services fields. Among baccalaureate - liberal arts institutions, St. Olaf ranks second in the nation in the number of graduates who earn Ph.D.s in education.</p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF ST. OLAF&rsquo;S TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM </h5>
              <p> St. Olaf is approved by the Minnesota Board of Teaching (BOT) to recommend its graduates for teaching licensure in Minnesota, and it is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). To be eligible for a teaching license through St. Olaf, students must meet the requirements  of their teaching content area (english, mathematics, music, social studies, etc.),  complete all B.A. or B.M. requirements (including a graduation  major), and complete all required education courses and experiences (see requirements below). </p>
              <p> The  Higher Education Act, Title II, Section 207, requires all institutions  that prepare teachers to report pass rates on state licensing tests. In  Minnesota, teacher candidates are required to pass the Pre-Professional Skills tests in reading, writing and mathematics. One hundred percent of the students who completed the St. Olaf Teacher Education Program have passed all PRAXIS I required by the state of Minnesota. Minnesota also requires additional tests in pedagogy and content area, PRAXIS II. Students seeking licensure in other states should contact the teacher licensure agency in those states. </p>
              <p> Note: Because of periodic changes in licensure requirements, check with the Education Department regarding your program. </p>
              <p> The requirements of the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/catalog/academicprogram/social-studies-ed.html">social studies education major</a> are described elsewhere in this catalog. </p>
              <p> St. Olaf offers these preparatory experiences in education: </p>
              <p> 1.	Secondary/middle school teaching (grades 5-12) in the following academic areas:  communication arts and literature (English, communications);  mathematics; science (biology, chemistry, physics); social studies  (economics, history, geography, political science, psychology,  sociology/anthropology) </p>
              <p> 2.	Kindergarten-12 level in the following academic areas: dance/ theater; English as a Second Language (ESL); music (vocal/classroom, instrumental/classroom); visual art; world languages (French, German, Latin, Spanish) </p>
              <p>3. Grades 5-8 content specialties (middle level), must be accompanied by a 5-12 or K-12 license. Communication Arts and Literature; Math; Science; Social Studies.</p>
              <p>4. Grades K-8 - World Languages (must accompany a 5-12 or K-12 license.)</p>
              <p> Although St. Olaf no longer offers its own elementary K-6 classroom licensure, students may begin to work towards their license while studying at St. Olaf and complete the requirements within one year after graduation at several different institutions--contact Robert McClure in the Education Department for further information. </p>
              <p> Coaching is no longer certified by the state, but there are several recommended coaching courses (see education or sports science faculty). </p>
