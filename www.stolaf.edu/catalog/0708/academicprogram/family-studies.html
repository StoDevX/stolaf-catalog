              <p class="programdescription"> As  the well-being of individuals and families has become a national  concern, the &ldquo;family&rdquo; as a focus for a discipline in higher education  has increased in significance. Since many disciplines  contribute to the understanding of families, family studies is an  integrative field which synthesizes knowledge from liberal arts  disciplines, particularly biology, psychology, sociology, and political  science, as well as others. </p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  family studies major provides academic linkages across disciplines  based in the liberal arts. The major supports the college&rsquo;s emphases on  cross-cultural and experiential learning. In preparation for graduate  level work and professional career opportunities, a research course  assists students to evaluate and critique research. The core courses  introduce students to the field of family studies and explore issues,  strengths, and roles within the family life span and the varied  dimensions of human sexuality and interpersonal experience. Lastly,  students explore special topics which focus on the explanation of  research and the connections between various disciplines in the study of families. </p>
