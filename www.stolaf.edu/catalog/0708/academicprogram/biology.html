              <p> <span class="programdescription">From  the molecules that are the building blocks of life to the complex  interactions between living beings and their environments, biology  continues to fascinate the human mind. The Biology Department offers a  diverse array of courses and experiences that present fundamental  biological principles and processes within the context of being  informed, responsible, and compassionate citizens. It provides a broad  range of learning opportunities through its course offerings,  laboratories, independent study/research, internships and off-campus  study programs  at sites including South India, Arizona, Costa Rica, Australia,  Bahamas, Galapagos Islands, and Northern Minnesota. Woven into all  learning opportunities are hands-on experiences with modern equipment that stimulate critical and independent thinking. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> For  science majors, the Biology Department offers an exciting slate of  challenging and rewarding courses. For the less science-oriented  student, it seeks to stimulate natural curiosity about how our bodies  work and how humans interact with their surroundings by providing  several courses designed primarily for non-science majors. These  courses, which satisfy the Studies in Natural Sciences requirement of  the general education curriculum, focus on current biological issues and general interest topics in biology. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  ever-broadening nature of biology requires diversely trained and  inquisitive biologists. The biology major has the dual mission of  introducing students to the information and technological tools of  various disciplines of biology while instilling the confidence to  critically assess a biological phenomenon and to design and carry out  an appropriate experiment. To that end, the biology major provides the  necessary content and instrument training while students practice the  art of scientific inquiry. Opportunities for interdisciplinary work abound. Biology majors are encouraged to participate  in faculty-based research, off-campus programs in biology, and in  departmental seminars and social activities. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Students majoring in biology complete eight biology courses and a year of chemistry   (Chemistry 121, 123, 126, or 125, 126). The integrated chemistry-biology  sequence (Chemistry/Biology 125, 126, 127) may be taken in lieu of Biology 125, Chemistry 125 and 126. The eight Biology courses must include: four core courses that emphasize cell/molecular  biology (Biology 125 or Chemistry/Biology 125-127), biodiversity and evolution (Biology 126),  genetics (Biology 233), and ecology (Biology 261); one course that focuses on a group of multicellular organisms (Biology 242, 247, 248, 251, 252, or 266); one Level III Biology course; two elective biology courses. (In general, completion  of at least two Level II courses are required to take a level III course.) Only one  Independent Study (Biology 298) or Independent Research (Biology 398)  can count toward the major; internships (Biology 294 or 394) do not  count toward the major. Biology 294 and 394 can only be taken P/N. </p>
              <p> In addition to courses designated as biology, the following courses can count as biology electives: Biochemistry (Chemistry 379), Conservation Biology (Environmental Studies 125), Introduction to Neuroscience  (Neuroscience 234) or Biopsychology (Psychology 238), Physiology of Exercise (Physical Education 375),   and Human Neuropsychology (Psychology 385) or other courses as  approved by petition to the department. For two of these courses to  count, they must be from different departments or programs. No more  than three Level I biology courses, including Biology 125 and 126, can  count toward the major. Only Biology Department courses (including Independent Research)  may count toward the Level III requirement. </p>
              <p> Students wishing to count for the major a course taken abroad or at another institution must consult with the chair before taking the class. </p>
              <p> While  programs leading to graduate work are planned on an individual basis,  most programs require students to have two or more quantitative courses  (mathematics, statistics, or computer science), two courses in physics,  and at least four courses in chemistry. </p>
              <p> Students intending to enter graduate or professional school are encouraged to consult with the biology faculty to plan a course of study appropriate for the postgraduate program. Students pursuing a secondary school Science Education Teaching License with a Life Science Specialty must complete the biology major including Biology 123 or 243 as one of their electives. Additional courses are required as specified by the Education Department. Interested students should consult faculty in the Education Department. </p>
              <p> The  prerequisite for Microbiology (Biology 231) and Human Anatomy and  Physiology (Biology 243) is Biology 125 or Chemistry/Biology 125-127. Genetics (Biology 233)  requires Biology 125 and completion or concurrent enrollment in  Chemistry 125 or Chemistry/Biology 125-127. All other Level II courses have prerequisites of Biology  125 or Chemistry/Biology 125-127 and Biology 126. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> The  Biology Department honors a limited number of graduating majors with  distinction in biology. Each spring the faculty reviews those eligible  for distinction and chooses students who best fulfill departmental  ideals of excellence, creativity, and interest in biology. Information  about the criteria considered in conferring distinction is available in the Biology Department Office. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> Research  opportunities are central to the teaching mission of the Biology  Department. In addition to Independent Research (Biology 398) and  project-based courses, each summer the Biology Department awards  several paid research positions to students interested in working with  faculty on current research projects. These 10-week positions,  supported by outside funding, offer excellent opportunities in both  lab and field research. Topics - Research (Bio 291) is a quarter credit opportunity for a journal club or other exploratory course offered at student request and the professor's discretion. </p>
              <p> The Biology Department offers many opportunities for off-campus study. Two semester-long programs, Biology in South India (offered every fall) and Environmental Science in Australia (offered alternating  Spring Semesters), are of particular interest to biology students.  Other semester/summer programs are available through affiliated  institutions or programs (e.g., ACM Oak Ridge Science Semester, ACM  Tropical Field Research, Coe College Wilderness Field Station,  Denmark&rsquo;s International Studies Program).  In addition, each Interim several off-campus biology courses are  offered. Off-campus Interim courses may include Desert Biology  (Arizona), Winter Ecology (Northern Minnesota), Island Biology  (Bahamas), Tropical Ecology (Costa Rica), Cardiac Physiology (Atlanta),  and Equatorial Biology (Ecuador, Galapagos Islands). Students  interested in off-campus biology courses should consult the International and Domestic Off-Campus Studies Office. </p>
              <p> Several  concentrations are offered that interface extensively with the Biology  Department: biomedical studies, biomolecular studies, environmental  studies, neuroscience, and statistics. Students interested in these  concentrations should consult their respective descriptions in this  catalog. </p>
