              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2007-08:</strong> Charles Umbanhowar, Jr. (Biology), paleoecology, grassland ecology </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Mark Allister (English), American literature, writing; Diane Angell (Biology), ecology and animal behavior; Eugene B.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Environmental  studies combines the strengths of disciplinary work in the contributing  departments  with interdisciplinary studies, giving both broad  and focused perspectives  on environmental problems and issues. The program offers a major in  environmental studies with three tracks or options in which students  may choose to focus their work: natural sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities. In many cases, work in these tracks overlaps  with traditional departmental curricula, and students may choose to  complete a second major there. Recognizing the global dimensions of  many environmental problems and the need for learning outside of the  classroom, the program provides a number of opportunities for studies  abroad and in the field. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> All  students majoring in environmental studies take four courses from a  common set of core offerings which emphasize the interdisciplinary  nature of environmental problems and issues. Students then choose one  of the three tracks in which to focus their work. Courses required from  two cognate groups outside of the selected track provide essential  knowledge, methods, and perspectives to complement the focus. All  majors complete an experiential component during their studies and take a capstone course for a total of 12 required courses. Students  wishing to count courses not specifically designated as satisfying  requirements for the major may petition the Environmental Studies  Advisory Board prior to enrollment. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  program also offers a concentration in environmental studies for  students wishing to complement a disciplinary major with a smaller core  of courses and electives focused on the environment. </p>

                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6> Social Science </h6>
                <p> The  social science track is a contract major in which students select a set  of disciplinary and cognate courses in consultation with an advisor. In  addition to the core courses and the capstone seminar (specified above), students will select seven additional courses from the following groups: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> One course in statistics or mathematical modeling </li>
                  <li> Social  Science Courses (two courses from the following list, in addition to  the social science course taken for the core requirement): Economics  242; Environmental Studies 225; Environmental Studies 232;  Environmental Studies 201; Environmental Studies 276; Political Science 221  (Australia); Sociology/Anthropology 222 (Australia); Sociology/Anthropology 249 or Environmental Studies 281/381 when taught as social sciences course. </li>
                  <li> Contract: Students will complete the major with an individualized contract tailored to their particular interests. The contract will consist of five courses that include substantive analysis of the environment  and represent a coherent theme. Three of the courses may be those  counted in the social science group above and the social science core.  When courses do not explicitly focus on the environment, students must  arrange with the instructor to write papers and other assignments with  environmental themes. Examples of possible contracts include:  environmental law, U.S. environmental policy, international environmental policy, the economy and the environment, environmental education, culture and the environment. </li>
                  <li> Cognate Courses (at least two courses: one from the natural sciences cognate group and one from the arts and humanities group) </li>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p> The  environmental studies concentration draws upon the disciplinary  strengths of a traditional major and a set of core courses focused on  the environment. Students may utilize environmental studies-related  upper-level courses within their own discipline to complete  requirements of the concentration. </p>
              <ol>
                <li> Core Courses: Students  electing the environmental studies concentration will complete the four  core courses required for environmental studies majors described above. </li>
                <li> Electives: Students  will choose two additional environmental studies courses from among  those listed in the core, cognate, or disciplinary groups above or from  the list of courses in other departments (below). This may include (but  need not) the senior seminar. Elective courses have a significant component  that addresses environmental concerns, but they need not have  environmental issues as their exclusive focus. For some electives,  students may be required to negotiate specific assignments with the  instructor and the Environmental Studies Advisory Committee to receive  credit toward the concentration. </li>
                <li> Experiential Component: All students concentrating in environmental studies will participate  in an experience which applies basic knowledge in a setting beyond the  classroom. This may be one of the many off-campus environmental studies  courses listed in the catalog or an internship or research project approved by the director. Criteria are listed on the environmental studies website. </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> A number of off-campus programs include an internship or independent study component in which stu-dents  may elect to focus on environmental issues. Students must consult with  the environmental studies director in planning their programs and must  receive approval before counting work from off-campus programs toward  an environmental studies concentration. The programs listed below have  a substantial focus in environmental studies and will generally satisfy  environmental studies requirements: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Biology in South India </li>
                <li> Environmental Studies in Australia </li>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-101"></a>101 The Culture of Nature</p>
<p>This American environmental history explores the social construction of nature in the 20th century,
looking at the roots (both natural and cultural) of contemporary environmental issues. To figure
out what nature means to us now, students study the history of stuff, the culture of grasslands and
lawns, the changing character of the city and the country, the nature of the suburbs, the
conservation and preservation movements, different energy ecologies, the nature of TV, the
contemporary environmental movement, and alternative ecological practices. They also use the
St. Olaf campus as a case study of 20th-century environmental design.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-125"></a>125 Conservation Biology</p>
<p>Conservation biology focuses on the study of biological diversity. Students examine why we
should be concerned about the number and types of species on earth, what factors threaten the
survival of species and how we can conserve them. Using principles of ecology and evolution,
with input from other disciplines, students gain a better understanding of the impact of humans
on biodiversity and the importance of responsible environmental decision-making.  Counts
toward major and concentration: Environmental Studies.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-137"></a>137 Introduction to Environmental Studies</p>
<p>This interdisciplinary seminar uses basic concepts of environmental science to explore global
environmental issues. Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and
participants will recognize many of the seminar issues from coverage in the media. Because
most environmental problems involve issues beyond the science, the seminar examines the
economic, political and ethical dimensions of environmental questions and environmental
decision-making.  Offered every semester.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-201"></a>201 Topics in Global Environmental Politics</p>
<p>Population growth, industrialization, and the consumption of fossil fuels have increased global
environmental problems. The course examines the ways in which nation-states and/or
international institutions have addressed these environmental concerns. Depending on the
instructor, the focus of the course is either the environmental problems of a particular area
(e.g., Latin America, Russia or Asia) or a broader global arena (e.g., international institutions
and the environment). Counts toward major and concentration: Environmental Studies.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-222"></a>222 Campus Ecology</p>
<p>This course explores key concepts of ecology, focusing explicitly on the ideal of ecological
sustainability for the St. Olaf College campus.  Students attend both to contemporary environmental
issues and to the ideas and institutions that shape human resource use.  Working groups research
topics such as curriculum, clothes, cars, water, waste, food, energy, procurement, and landscape
in the context of American religious and environmental values.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-225"></a>225 Environmental Political Theory</p>
<p>This course examines relations between conceptions of "nature" and political issues of power,
justice, liberty, and equality; and it explores theoretical foundations from which ecologically
grounded institutions, policies, and political understandings arise.  The course attends to issues
currently being addressed by international green political theorists, including "ecological
citizenship" and "green democracy."</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-232"></a>232 Environmental Policy and Regulation</p>
<p>This course analyzes environmental regulation in the United States with respect to its historical
evolution, its ability to achieve environmental targets, its efficiency or cost-effectiveness, its
distributional impact on jobs, people, and industries across the country, and its international
ramifications. Class meetings include open discussions with individuals from agencies charged
with developing and enforcing environmental regulation.  Offered annually.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-245"></a>245 Global Climate Change</p>
<p>This course is an interdisciplinary seminar on climate throughout the earth's history,
including recent changes caused by humankind. It examines the climate system in the larger
framework of planetary evolution and explores evidence from the geologic record for climates
of the past. Using current scientific literature, students investigate causes of climate
change and consider scenarios for future climate based on models incorporating alternative
global development strategies.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-255"></a>255 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems</p>
<p>Remote sensing and GIS are increasingly used to address basic and applied questions in the
environmental sciences and a host of other disciplines. Students survey available remote sensing
image types and learn to process (ground-truthing, GPS, scanning, digitizing) and interpret
remotely sensed images. They also learn theory and practice of geographic information systems
(basic cartography and spatial statistics). A weekly 3-hour laboratory is required. Counts toward
major and concentration: Environmental Studies.  Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 137 or
a Level 1 course in biology, chemistry or physics.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="environ-studies-259"></a>259 Saving Wild Places</p>
<p>The discussion of wilderness today often focuses on non-human benefits, such as the protection
of biodiversity or wildlife habitat. A significant tradition of American thought and literature
also emphasizes the benefits of wilderness for human beings, including spirituality, freedom,
morality, self-reliance, and solitude. This seminar, offered annually, explores the importance of
