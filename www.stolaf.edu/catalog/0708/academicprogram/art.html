Internship opportunities are possible in specialized  fields of study that involve students in the workaday professional art  world. Both art history and studio students can take advantage of the  Minneapolis Art Institute, the Walker Art Center, and other  Minneapolis-St. Paul art institutions. Studio majors also can gain  professional experience in the Twin Cites in the areas of graphic  design, illustration, architecture, etc. </p>
        <h5 class="goldhead"> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL OR PROFESSIONAL STUDY </h5>
        <h6> Studio Art </h6>

Also recommended  is participation in special programs incorporating advanced work, such  as internships or one-semester study at cooperating art schools. A  unique fifth-year program of apprenticeship offered by the Art and Art  History Department provides studio space to a limited number of  exceptional art student applicants who wish to spend the year after  graduation concentrating on building a strong portfolio in preparation  for graduate studies. </p>
        <h6> Art History </h6>
        <p> The  prospective graduate student, following the completion of one or two  survey courses, should take at least one course each in medieval, Renaissance,  modern, and a non-Western area of art and a second course in an area of  interest and should at least start studying an appropriate world language.  Those interested in the museum professions should also seek an  internship. Art 350: The Methods of Art History is taught as a seminar  with student presentations and discussions patterned on typical  graduate school offerings. The department reserves the right to retain  student work for its file. </p>
