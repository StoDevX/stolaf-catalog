              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2007-08:</strong> Judy Kutulas (History), 20th-century American history, American women's history, media history </span></p>
              <p class="faculty"> <strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Mark Allister (English), environmental literature, American regionalism, men&rsquo;s studies; Carolyn Anderson (Sociology/Anthropology), Native Americans, jazz, music, theory and gender; James Farrell (History), contemporary culture, consumer culture, environmental history, the sixties; Steven Hahn (History), Early American history, Native American history; Carol Holly (English), American literature, American women writers, American autobiography; DeAne Lagerquist (Religion); Bruce Nordstrom-Loeb (Sociology/Anthropology), gender and race, gay and lesbian studies, cross-cultural perspectives; Matthew Rohn (Art History), visual culture, 20th century art; Mary Titus (English), women writers, southern writers, race and American literature; Colin Wells (English), early American literature, the Beat Generation </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The American Studies Program operates on Lionel Trilling&rsquo;s premise that &ldquo;the primary function  of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of  his [or her] culture in the environmental sense and to permit him [or  her] to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.&rdquo; Both the matter and the method of American studies are encompassed by the national motto &ldquo;E Pluribus Unum,&rdquo; which suggests that we create communities  &mdash; both cultural and academic &mdash; from differences. American culture is a  complex dialectic of different regional and cultural strains, and the  best methodological approach to America is a multiplicity of  disciplinary perspectives, unified by the analytical and integrative  skills of each student. By discovering the American cultural patterns  that influence their lives, students learn how to make lives of  critical consequence. Their interdisciplinary training also helps them to make a living in a variety of ways &mdash; as journalists, attorneys, ministers, social workers, educators, etc. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The American studies major is structured for both exploration and coherence. The Level I seminar introduces  and integrates different disciplinary questions and concepts in the  study of contemporary culture. The Level II seminar combines different  disciplines to study a single topic or time period. And the Level III  seminar invites students to participate in a substantial  interdisciplinary research project. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> In  consultation with an advisor, students construct nine-course majors  which normally include American Studies 100, a 200-level topics course  and a 300-level seminar (when subjects are different, the topics course  and the seminar may be taken more than once) and six designated  disciplinary courses (with at least one course in each of three  departments). Of the nine courses, at least three must be at Level III.  Students in the American Conversations program should consult with the director. </p>
              <p> Because  the United States is composed of a multiplicity of peoples, at least  one course dealing with racial and multicultural studies is  recommended. Because American studies is an active interaction with an  ongoing culture, we recommend programs of service and/or internships.  Because American studies is implicitly comparative, we also recommend  the &ldquo;perspective by incongruity&rdquo; of foreign study. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Seniors  majors may apply for distinction in American studies. Candidates must  satisfy minimum GPA requirements (3.3 overall, 3.50 in the major),  prepare a research project under the direction of a faculty adviser and  submit their work for faculty review. Students declare their interest  by Oct. 15 of their senior year; the review occurs in April. </p>
