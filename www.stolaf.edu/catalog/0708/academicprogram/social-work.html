              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/social-work/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/social-work/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2007-08:</strong> Mary Carlsen (Social Work and Family Studies), social policy, professional ethics, cross-cultural practice </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Naurine Lennox (Social Work), social service systems and history, rural and community practice, research; Valerie Green (Social Work</span>), practice, field education </p>
              <p>St.  Olaf students prepare for lives of service as responsible and  knowledgeable citizens. Those who study social work are committed to  enhancing human well-being and alleviating suffering. Social work, a program in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies, builds on students&rsquo; liberal education by enabling them critically to examine need, illumine  inherent human strengths, reflect on their ethical conduct, and explore  policies and programs that address social problems. The program mission  is to prepare students ethically to serve diverse populations and  promote a just global community. Completing a bachelor of arts degree  in social work prepares students for beginning generalist professional  practice with diverse clients, both rural and urban. The Council on  Social Work Education accredited the program in 1990; graduates meet  requirements for the licensure examination at the baccalaureate level.  </p>
              <p>Courses  meet WRI, MCS-G, HBS, and ORC and are appropriate for students who  are interested in social welfare, the Peace Corps, Americorps, Lutheran Volunteer Corps, or related areas like  family studies, education, church work, and human resources. Level 300  courses are reserved for majors.  </p>
              <p>Students  considering social work graduate school are strongly encouraged to  consult faculty about appropriate undergraduate courses. The program  also provides preparation for graduate study in marriage and family  counseling, non-profit management, social policy, ministry, special education, law, and related fields. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <p> Social work education builds on the liberal arts with professional foundation courses. It prepares, for generalist  practice, students who understand scientific approaches to knowledge  building and practice, are reflective of and responsible for their own  ethical conduct, and are committed to lives of service and leadership  in the global community. Courses are sequential, culminating with the  400-hour field practicum and capstone course with a project. Students  gain experience with individuals, groups, families, organizations,  and communities in settings as diverse as child welfare, health, and  corrections. Practicums are in the nearby communities; placement  elsewhere can be arranged with advance preparation. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Those interested in the major should contact the program director in their first year or as early as possible.  Students in good standing at the college who have satisfactorily  completed prerequisite courses and Social Work 221 are eligible to  apply for admission to the program. Students are granted major status  only after satisfactory completion of Social Work 221, 246, 254, and a  program application. Students must achieve a grade of C or better in  all prerequisite and required courses to progress in the program.  Details are specified in the Program Manual available from faculty. </p>
              <p><strong> Prerequisite Courses Required for the Major </strong></p>
              <p> Sociology 121, Psychology 125 <span class="programdescription">and</span> 241, and Biology 123 <span class="programdescription">or</span> 243. </p>
              <div>
                <h6> Foundation Social Work Courses Required for the Major </h6>
                <p> 221, 246, 254, 258, 261, 274, 373, 380, and 381.  Students must be admitted to the social work program and in good  academic standing to register for all 300-level courses. A field  practicum of at least 400 clock hours (Social Work 380 block  practicum), professionally supervised in an affiliated agency, is  required during fall semester of the senior year. Social Work 373 and  380 together constitute a full semester&rsquo;s work (3.5 credits). Field  practicum experience may be completed while living on or off campus.  Statistics is strongly recommended, especially for students who  anticipate graduate study. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> ADMISSION TO AND RETENTION IN THE SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM </h5>
              <p> The  program actively seeks and encourages students from diverse backgrounds  to consider a social work major and provides one-to-one advising. </p>
              <p> First- and second-year students interested in social work are encouraged to submit an Interest Inventory.  It is in the Program Manual, available from program faculty, and on the program website. The  program application, admission requirements, requirements to remain in  good standing in the program, processes for petitioning reinstatement, and grievance procedures for redress of any adverse decision are also in the Manual. The program does not discriminate against any student on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, culture, class, religion, national origin, age, physical or mental ability, sexual orientation, public assistance status, or geographic location. Students are formally notified in writing of admission to the program by mid-December of the junior year. </p>
              <p> Students  who transfer to St. Olaf at or before the beginning of the junior  (third) year may be considered for admission to the program, provided  they have completed equivalent prerequisite courses in sociology,  psychology, and human biology. Field practicum and methods courses must  be completed while enrolled at St. Olaf. No credit or waiver is given  for previous internship, work, or  life experience. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  St. Olaf Social Work Program encourages student participation in  off-campus programs, both domestic and international. Majors can  conveniently schedule an Interim abroad, including Social Work 256:  Family Social Services in Central Mexico and Family Studies 263:  Indigenous Cultures of Australia. To participate in a  semester program off-campus (e.g., HECUA in South America, ACM Chicago  Urban Studies, Tanzania, Namibia, or Mexico) and complete the program  requirements in four years, students must plan early and carefully with  the help of social work faculty. St. Olaf co-sponsors  Social Work in a Latin American Context (Mexico) for social work majors  in the spring semester of the junior year which fulfills major  requirements. </p>
              <p> Students  often count social work courses for other  interdisciplinary majors and concentrations including family studies, American racial  and multicultural studies, biomedical studies, and women&rsquo;s studies.  Social work majors are eligible for student-rate membership in the National  Association of Social Workers and to receive its publications. </p>
              <p> Social  work faculty occasionally supervise students doing independent work in  social welfare and social service. Completing the social work major is  possible only through the regular college, however. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
