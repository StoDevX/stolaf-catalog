              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2007-08: </strong>Kris Thalhammer, comparative politics, Latin American politics </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong>  Jo Beld, American politics, public policy; Douglas Casson, political theory, American constitutional law; J. Patrick Dale, Comparative politics, Russian, Eurasian, and European politics; Shirin Deylami, Political theory, Islamic theory and feminist theory; Daniel Hofrenning, American politics, public policy; Serena Laws, American constitutional law; Anthony Lott, international relations, global enviromental politics; Don Ostrom, American politics; Jonathan Peterson, American politics, political psychology; Katherine Tegtmeyer-Pak, comparative politics, Asian politics, international relations </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Political  science is the systematic study of government, politics, and public  policies in the United States and around the world. Students in  political science courses learn to frame thoughtful questions, consider  diverse perspectives, marshal convincing evidence, and communicate  with clarity and conviction about the major issues of public life. Many  political science courses satisfy general education requirements (see  below). The Political Science Department shares faculty and courses  with American studies, Asian studies, environmental studies, Hispanic  studies, Russian studies, and women&rsquo;s studies. It also cooperates with  the Education Department in its social studies education major. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of political science is often combined with majors in English,  economics, history, philosophy, foreign language, or any of a number of  interdisciplinary majors and concentrations.  Many political science students go on to complete graduate and  professional degrees, not only in political science but also in law,  education, public policy, international affairs, management  and administration, or communications. Our graduates become policy  analysts, teachers, legislators, advocates, attorneys, business owners,  consultants, public relations managers,  ambassadors, administrators, researchers, and journalists. The study of  political science enriches students&rsquo; experience of the liberal arts and  prepares them to engage in public life as responsible citizens and  reflective leaders. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The political science major provides broad exposure to the discipline and develops skills in critical thinking, systematic inquiry, and effective writing and speaking. Students majoring in political science complete courses in four areas: American politics and public policy, comparative politics, international relations,  and political theory. Political science majors also encounter and apply  a variety of approaches to studying political behavior and public  policy, with particular emphasis on social scientific inquiry. Advanced  seminars and independent study courses provide opportunities for  specialized study and advanced research. Off-campus courses,  internships, and other experiential learning experiences engage  students with the realities of public life. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Students majoring in political science must complete a minimum of nine courses in the discipline, including  no more than three Level I courses, one course introducing research  methods (Political Science 220, Analyzing Politics and Policy), and no  fewer than two Level III courses. </p>
              <p> Majors must include at least one course from each of the four subfields: American politics and public policy  (111, 114, 115,  246, 255, 272,  311); comparative  politics (112, 117,  252, 256, 264, 282, 283, 367, 386); international  relations (119, 121, 245, 257, 258, 281, 285, 321) and political theory  (113, 222, 249, 259, 260, 270, 384). The subfield designation of  Political Science Topics (199, 299), Independent Study (298),  Independent Research (398), Seminar (399), Interim courses or other  courses not listed above depends on the content of the course in a  given semester; students should consult with their advisers and with the department academic administrative assistant to determine  the appropriate subfield for one of these courses. All Level III  courses are offered as seminars with two prerequisites: PS 220 and one  other course in the relevant subfield. </p>
              <p> Students  may designate a selected Statistics course (110, 212, 262, 266, or 312)  OR one additional semester of language beyond the level of proficiency  required for general education (French, German, or Spanish numbered  above 232 or Chinese, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Norwegian, or Russian  numbered above 231) as one of their nine courses in the political  science major. Additional study in statistics and/or foreign language  is especially recommended for students considering graduate study. </p>
              <p> Political  science majors are also encouraged to seek out opportunities for  experiential or applied study through internships, off-campus study,  on-campus courses with an experiential component, or independent  projects under faculty supervision. Up to two off-campus courses  instructed by non-St. Olaf faculty may be included in the major. An  internship for academic credit may also count toward the major,  although internships cannot be used to satisfy subfield requirements.  Additional suggestions and guidelines  for including off-campus work and experiential study in the political  science major are available in the department; students are encouraged  to consult with their advisers in making their plans. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> GENERAL EDUCATION </h5>
              <p> The  Political Science Department offers courses that satisfy general  education requirements in Human Behavior and Society (HBS), Historical  Studies in Western Culture (HWC), Multicultural Studies (MCS), and  Ethical Issues and Normative Perspectives (EIN). In addition, all Level  III courses are designated Courses with Writing (WRI). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Distinction  in political science is awarded to graduating students whose work  reflects the qualities of exemplary scholarship in the discipline:  theoretical competence, skillful research, analytic ability, original  thinking, clear and compelling discourse, and significance for public  life. In addition to meeting minimum  grade point average requirements (3.8 within the major), senior  candidates for distinction submit for departmental review a major  research paper demonstrating these qualities. Candidates must notify  the department chair of their intention to seek distinction in the  first week of the spring semester and must submit their distinction  papers no later than April 15. Further information on distinction in  political science is available in the department or on the department&rsquo;s website. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> Political  science students may choose from a rich assortment of domestic and  international off-campus study opportunities, some during Interim and  others lasting a semester or more (see Index). They can also arrange  for credited internships in a wide variety of settings, from law  offices and campaign organizations to the national or state  legislature. Further information on internships, Interim off-campus  course offerings, and other special programs such as the Washington Semester and international programs with political science credit, is available in the department or from the Office of International and Off-Campus Studies. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-111"></a>111 American Politics</p>
<p>The promise of American politics is the equal freedom of all. How does practice match
principles? What roles do class and race play? Do interest groups and political parties foster
democracy? This course is designed not only to help students understand American government
and politics but also to motivate them to be active and informed participants.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-112"></a>112 Comparative Politics</p>
<p>Why do some societies have democratic political systems and others authoritarian ones? What
is democracy? Is it the norm or the exception? The course provides a foundation for the
understanding of contemporary political regimes. It applies the major concepts of comparative
analysis to the political systems of Western and non-Western societies.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-113"></a>113 Introduction to Political Theory</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to some of the central, interrelated concepts and questions of
political theory. Some of the readings will be drawn from recognized classics in the field while
others will arise from contemporary debates about political issues and cultural diversity within
the U.S. The course pays considerable attention to historical shifts in political thought but is
not designed to provide a chronology of the great Western political thinkers. Instead, this course
aims to provoke and sustain a semester-long exploration of what it means to be a political actor --
that is, a citizen -- and what it means to think about politics.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-117"></a>117 Politics and Human Rights</p>
<p>What makes a person capable of repression? Who obeys morally unjust orders to torture or kill
innocent victims? What causes genocide? Who risks his or her life to defend others' rights?
Using case studies from around the world, this course looks at various explanations for the
range of ways individuals respond to immoral government actions, with special emphasis on
theories of political psychology.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-119"></a>119 The Problem of War</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to introduce students to the long tradition of debate concerning the
nature and legitimacy of war.  The course explores the reality of war, the revulsion of violence and
the possibility of just war through texts ranging from Thucydides, Aquinas, and Freud.  The course
explores contemporary debates in light of moral and empirical arguments learned.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-121"></a>121 International Relations</p>
<p>War and peace, justice and power -- these are age-old topics of the politics among nations.
This course examines them by emphasizing certain problem areas in the world and evaluating the
principal theories for understanding international politics.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-220"></a>220 Analyzing Politics and Policies</p>
<p>This course explores the diverse modes of inquiry in the discipline of political science.  Broadly
centered around the question, "How do you know?," students focus on different methods of
locating and collecting data, reviewing political texts and contested concepts, and constructing
theoretical explanations of political phenomena. Prerequisite: one previous course in department.
Offered both semesters.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-222"></a>222 Politics</p>
<p>An exploration of the key words and concepts of politics (nation, government, constitution,
revolution, law, justice, rights, wealth, power and status), this course is designed to assist
students in developing their understanding of political life. Students also learn by playing
the simulation game, Monopolity. Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-245"></a>245 Nationalism, Regionalism, Globalization in Asia</p>
<p>Currents of nationalism, regionalism and globalization organize political life around the world.
What trends and policies promote regional integration? What forces frustrate integration? To
answer these questions this course investigates security, economic, and cultural relations at the
beginning of the 21st century within Asia and between Asia and Russia and the U.S. This course
looks at the historical interaction of national, regional and global forces for additional answers.
Prerequisites: Previous course in Asian Studies or Political Science, or permission of instructor.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-246"></a>246 Introduction to Public Policy</p>
<p>The product of the political process is public policy. This course surveys the major areas of
domestic public policy in the United States: education, welfare, health, housing, the environment,
and the economy with special attention to the impact of public policies on women and minorities.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-247"></a>247 Political Ethics and Public Policy</p>
<p>The course uses a range of historical and current case studies to examine the ways in which
ethical standards are applied to complex political issues such as state use of violence,
governmental secrecy and deceit, official disobedience, health-case access, welfare reform,
and environmental regulation and protection.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-249"></a>249 Distributive Justice</p>
<p>What distribution of wealth and the rewards from work and the possession of productive
property is just? Are we entitled to economic support simply because we are members of
society, or should we accept impoverishment as the just consequence of failure in the market?
Students examine Christian and non-Christian ethical traditions from Europe and America which
are devoted to answering these and related questions.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-252"></a>252 Politics and Development</p>
<p>Some formerly developing countries have found the way to join the ranks of the industrialized
nations, others have not. What explains the difference? By introducing students to theories of
modernization, dependency, world systems, order, class, revolution, state, and political
economy, the course attempts to provide the framework for answering this question.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-254"></a>254 Japanese Politics and Society</p>
<p>This course familiarizes students with the social and political forces characterizing contemporary
Japan, the world's second most powerful economy and a leading example of a successful liberal
democracy.  Students examine how Japanese citizens, interest groups, bureaucrats, and
politicians are negotiating issues related to economic prosperity, the aging of their society,
inequality, globalization, and international affairs.  Students also consider major features of
Japan's democracy -- governmental structures, electoral procedures, and political history.
Recommended: One previous course in political science or Asian Studies.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-255"></a>255 Political Parties and Elections</p>
<p>
Political parties have traditionally served to organize the American electoral process but not to govern. Is their role changing? This course examines party organization, candidate recruitment, campaign strategies, the role of the media, election financing, and citizen participation. </p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-256"></a>256 Central European Politics</p>
<p>Sandwiched between Germany and Russia, East-Central Europe, has exhibited distinctive political
characteristics in its pre-communist, communist, and now post-communist periods. The region
could not sustain democracy in the 1930s. Does it have a better chance of doing so in the 21st
century? In pursuit of an answer, students examine the varying cultural, ethnic, and economic
contexts of the region's contemporary political problems.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-257"></a>257 U.S. -- Latin American Relations</p>
<p>Often controversial, U.S.-Latin American relations occupy a special place in the foreign policy of
the United States. Students compare differing views of political issues of importance to both
regions and explore the emergence of U.S. power, interventionism, cooperation, revolution,
collective security, the transition to democracy, and the influence of economic factors on the
relationship between Latin America and the U.S.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-258"></a>258 World Politics</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to expand students' knowledge of conflict, cooperation, trade,
development, inequality, imperialism, and power in world politics.  The course uses substantive
examples to teach about issues and institutions in "world politics" and to examine appropriate
mechanisms to understand and explain international phenomena.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-259"></a>259 History of Classical Political Thought</p>
<p>Socrates founded political philosophy by asking the question "What is justice?"  Ancient political
philosophers followed his lead offering different answers. Students study the most famous works
of classical political philosophy and their relation to larger themes in contemporary politics. The
main texts assigned are Plato's <I>Republic</I>, Aristotle's <I>Politics</I> and selections from
St. Augustine's <I>City of God</I> and St. Thomas Aquinas' <I>Summa</I>.</p>

<p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-260"></a>260 History of Modern Political Thought</p>
<p>Machiavelli founded modern political philosophy by asking "How does the ruler acquire power?"
This course explores how modern political thinkers answered this question by changing the grounds
of authority from religious and philosophical foundations to rational ones. Texts include
Machiavelli's <I>Prince</I> and Hobbes's <I>Leviathan</I>, Locke's <I>Second Treatise</I>,
Rousseau's <I>Social Contract</I>, Marx's <I>Communist Manifesto</I>, and Nietzsche's <I>Use and
Abuse of History</I>.</p>
 
 <p class="coursename"><a name="poli-sci-264"></a>264 Latin American Politics</p>
<p>How do the peoples of Latin America participate politically?  How do domestic politics interact
with national and international economics?  How do states treat challenges posed by migration
