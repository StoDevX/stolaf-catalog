            <h2 class="programname"> Media Studies </h2>
            <div>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Director, 2007-08:</strong> William Sonnega (Theatre) </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  primary purpose of media studies is to promote media literacy and  encourage students to become informed consumers and creators of media  products and services. Students pursuing an interdisciplinary  concentration in media studies in a liberal arts context take courses  that survey the history of the mass media, the dominant theories and  practices that shape media representation, and the effects of the mass  media on individuals and groups. Media studies courses are taught from  a variety of disciplinary perspectives and are united by the assumption  that informed media users are better able to exercise ethical judgment  in determining which media are best for themselves, their families, and  communities and society in general. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p> With  the approval of the program director, students assemble individualized  programs of study involving a total of five courses. A concentration  consists of a common introductory course, Media Studies 160, plus three  approved courses drawn from departments and programs across the  curriculum, an academic internship in a media-related field, and a  Digital Portfolio. The purpose of the Digital Portfolio is to compile a variety of materials related to a Media Studies education in an integrative and useful way. The portfolio ultimately is burned to a DVD that students can take with them and reproduce as needed. </p>
              <p> Requirements  and plans for individual portfolios are discussed at two mandatory  meetings for all Media Studies concentrators, one in each of the fall  and spring semesters. Graduating concentrators will submit their completed portfolios to the program director by April 1 of their senior year. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> MEDIA INTERNSHIP </h5>
              <p> Students  pursuing the media studies concentration enroll in and complete a  credit-bearing, academic internship in a media-related field, e.g., film, television, video,  radio, Internet, newspaper, magazine, book publishing, journalism,  public relations, marketing, advertising, or graphic design. The  internship may be undertaken  at any time during a program of study. To secure academic credit for a summer internship, students must register for summer session II by June 1. Students are responsible for  securing personal internships and consult with the program director and  director of academic internships in the Center for Experiential  Learning for additional information and guidance. </p>
            </div>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="media-studies-160"></a>160 Mass Media</p>
<p>This introductory-level course is part of a two-course sequence that encourages students to
assess and shape their personal relationship to mass media. Its premise is that we are all, to
some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media projects and services rather than
conscientious and socially minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a
comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped,
and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development
of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical
perspectives.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="media-studies-260"></a>260 Media and Contemporary Culture</p>
<p>This course focuses on contemporary media, primarily film and television, from theoretical
and critical perspectives. Primary emphasis is given to the specific identifying
characteristics of news, advertising and entertainment media and to how those media serve as
forums for cultural negotiation in our society. In particular, attention is paid to how media
representations of race, class and gender presently exist as both products and producers of
contemporary cultures. Prerequisite: Media Studies 160.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="media-studies-270"></a>270 Film Genres</p>
<p>This course explores the development of selected film genres (such as horror, film noir, and
documentary film) from the beginnings of film to the present, assessing the impact of each genre
on the cinema of one or more nations. Students examine how genres have been re-imagined in
different cultures or time periods and how cultural rituals and myths, icons and archetypes, and
hybridization affect the development of genres. Prerequisite: Media Studies 160 or permission of
the instructor.</p>

 <p class="coursename">294, 394 Internship</p>
 <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="media-studies-396"></a>396 Directed Undergraduate Research: "Topic Description"</p>
<p>This course provides a comprehensive research opportunity, including an introduction to relevant
background material, technical instruction, identification of a meaningful project, and data
collection.  The topic is determined by the faculty member in charge of the course and may
relate to his/her research interests.  Prerequisite: Determined by individual instructor.  Offer
based on department decision.</p>
