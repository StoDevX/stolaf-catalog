              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2007-08: </strong>Karl J. Fink, Goethe, Herder, and Weimar Classicism </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Karen R. Achberger,   (on leave), 20th-century literature, cinema, Austrian literature; Nicole Grewling, 19th-century German literature and culture; LaVern J. Rippley, German Romanticism, German American studies </span></p>
              <p class="style1"> German is among the five world languages significant by numbers of speakers, by geographic location, and by educational distinction. Even as Europe gathers strength in economic unity, it relies more than ever on the individual richness of its partner states. In a radius of 1000 kilometers (625 miles), Germany lies at the center of a European population of 300 million people. In this capacity, she plays a key role in the political, economic, and educational dynamics of the continent. Although English has become the language of the marketplace, German continues to drive innovation from bio-fuel technology to lyrical compositions. For centuries German has been a tool in the advancement of arts and sciences. </p>
              <p><em>Germany participates in the Erasmus credit exchange system among partner universities in Europe. The system facilitates financial and curricular reciprocity unique to the continent with a growing tendency to stretch the transfer value to countries around the globe. For Germans, study abroad is a way of life built on the academic freedom of students from medieval times to travel from university to university on the trail of preferred professors and courses of study. Since 1945 Germany has opened its academic doors to the world, for only nominal tuition fees sharing its research in science and technology, its specialized training in the fine arts, and its rich archival collections in the humanities, with only one requirement: German language proficiency. </em></p>
              <p><em>As Goethe wrote in his </em>Propylaeum<em> to higher education, learning a foreign language is directly proportional to the knowledge gained from it. That is why language placement becomes the starting point for education in the  liberal arts. The students' first contact with the German program at St. Olaf College is the on-line placement exam that assures smooth transitions into the courses offered in the department and in study abroad programs in Germany. The exam is keyed to a curriculum of stituational encounters shared by students in the modern world. As students advance through our German program they engage some of Europe's greatest writers, scientists, artists, musicians, theologians and philosophers. Learning German takes students beyond the vocational benefits of bi-lingual skills to  innovation and understanding found in the liberal arts. </em></p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> Majoring  in German allows students to deepen their understanding of German  culture and to develop their communication skills in both the written  and spoken language. </p>
              <p>In courses for the major, students gain an understanding of German literature, civilization, and contemporary culture as they develop analytical and communication skills in the language. All courses for the German major are taught in German.</p>
              <p>German majors are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of the study or internship opportunities abroad (see below), during either an Interim, summer, semester, or full-year program.</p>
              <p>Level II courses beyond the language requirement are divided into two sequences. </p>
              <p>In  250-level courses, students focus intensively on development of their  language skills while learning to do close textual analysis. These  courses, which are targeted primarily at first- and second-year  students, provide an introduction to the content areas of the major while sharpening specific critical and linguistic skills. The targeted proficiency level is ACTFL Advanced. All 250-level courses count toward the German major and are open to non-majors. </p>
              <p>In  270-level courses, students continue to explore new content areas in German culture at the same time advancing language skills to writing strategies for seminar papers. Courses at this level are designed to prepare students for level III seminar work. The targeted proficiency level is ACTFL Advanced or Advanced Plus. </p>
              <p> Level  III courses  build upon students&rsquo; interpretive skills and the knowledge of the German-speaking world they have gained in 270-level courses, as well as through study in Germany. Students examine in depth a particular genre, author, or topic through the analysis and interpretation of representative works. The targeted proficiency level is ACTFL Superior. All study abroad courses taught in German count toward the 270-level courses. </p>
              <p> Students  need not be German majors to take Level II and III courses or to study  abroad. Most begin their study of German in the 231-232 sequence. They  complete this sequence and take at least one writing  course on campus at the 250-level or above before spending a semester  or a year studying in Germany. Courses taken in Germany may satisfy  general education requirements as well as requirements for the German  or other majors. </p>
              <p>Courses taken abroad in english may count toward the major in other departments with prior approval. </p>
