              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2007-08:</strong> Margaret Hayford O&rsquo;Leary, Norwegian literature and language </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Nancy Aarsvold, Norwegian language, language pedagogy, instructional technology; Torild Homstad, Norwegian literature and language; Louis Janus, Norwegian literature and language; Kari Lie, Norwegian language, language pedagogy; Anne Sabo, Norwegian literature and language; Solveig Zempel, Norwegian literature and language </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">Students  at St. Olaf have the opportunity to study a unique subject &mdash; Norwegian.  St. Olaf is one of a few colleges and universities where students can  use Norwegian to complete their foreign language requirement &mdash; and  beyond the requirement can study the language, literature,  culture, and history of Norway in depth. In addition to graduating with  a major in Norwegian, St. Olaf students have many opportunities to  study and travel in Norway. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of Norwegian opens the door to another culture and another way of  viewing the world. Students develop skills in communication, research,  analytical thinking, and writing  that are essential to a liberal education and are useful in a wide  range of careers. They learn about Norway&rsquo;s role in high technology,  environmental awareness, social equality, and international  peace initiatives. Some of the world&rsquo;s best literature awaits discovery  by students of Norwegian: works by authors like Ibsen, Hamsun, and  Undset, as well as by writers who have not been translated into  English. Norwegian also enables many students to explore their cultural  heritage and encourages contact with relatives and friends in Norway. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The Norwegian major allows students to gain competence in the Norwegian language and an understanding  of Norwegian society through a combination of courses in the language,  literature, history, and culture of Norway. Norwegian majors are  encouraged to use their language skills for learning in other disciplines and to experience the culture firsthand through study in Norway. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> The  required courses are Norwegian 111, 112, 231, 232, 253, 371, 372, one history/cultural component (Norwegian 140, History 222, Art 266, or  other approved course), plus one additional upper level course chosen  in consultation with the chair. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Distinction in Norwegian should reflect a special interest in some aspect of Norwegian language and culture. A distinction paper or project may spring out of course work, but must go beyond and must incorporate  some public activity, whether that be print publication, website  development, oral presentation, or other public performance. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  Norwegian Department sponsors many speakers and activities such as the  annual Christmas service and Seventeenth of May breakfast and provides  students with the opportunity to live in a language house with a native  speaker assistant. The Norwegian-American Historical Association, a  rich source of information  on Norwegian immigration, is housed in R&oslash;lvaag Memorial Library. Many  students choose to study in Norway on a variety of programs. For  information on the Oslo International Summer School and the  International Studies programs in Norway, consult the Index. Norwegian  professors also participate  in the Foreign Language Across the Curriculum (FLAC) program,  collaborating with disciplinary professors to offer students the  opportunity to use their foreign language skills in selected courses in  other departments.

Taught in English.</p>

men and clever women engage in a heroic struggle with a tough and unyielding nature and face

works will be read in their historical and cultural context, as well as examining their impact on
popular culture, including film, video games, comics, and sci-fi/fantasy fiction.  Taught in
