              <h6><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/philosophy/"> http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/philosophy/ </a></h6>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Chair, 2007-08:</strong> Corliss Swain, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, Hume, value theory </span></p>
              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2007-08:</strong> Karen Gervais, biomedical ethics, ethics and health policy, philosophy of law, social and political philosophy, feminist philosophy; Geoffrey A. Gorham, philosophy and history of science, early modern philosophy, metaphysics, logic, medieval and ancient philosophy;  Jeanine Grenberg, ethics, Kant, history of modern philosophy; Vicki Lynn Harper, ancient Greek philosophy, logic, ethics; Edward Langerak, ethics, Kant, social and political philosophy; Jennifer Manion, moral philosophy, social and political philosophy, feminist theory, gender/sexuality studies; Gordon Marino, Kierkegaard, existentialism, ancient Greek philosophy; Anthony Rudd, Kierkegaard, epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics, history of philosophy; Edmund Santurri, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of religion, political philosophy; Charles Taliaferro, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, ethics </span></p>
              <p> <span class="programdescription">The  aim of the Philosophy Department is to engage students in disciplined  and imaginative thinking about philosophical issues. Philosophical  questions fall primarily into four groups: questions about the nature  of reality (metaphysics), about reasoning and inference (logic), about  knowledge (epistemology), and about values and society, including moral  values (ethics) and aesthetic values. These questions, which arise  naturally in the course of a liberal education, are not only  fascinating in their own right, they also touch on issues central to  understanding and improving human life in our own society and in the  world. Because they involve complex and controversial issues, there are  no easy answers. Yet it matters greatly which answers are accepted, and  it is therefore important to engage in discussion with others who face  these questions and to seek to learn from the philosophers of the past  and present. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Engaging  in philosophy develops skills in careful and fair-minded  interpretation, creative but rigorous argumentation, and perceptive,  wise evaluation of complex issues. These valuable  abilities are applicable to any subject matter and in any human context  and are useful for negotiating the ambiguities of today&rsquo;s career paths. </p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Students  can find philosophy courses that satisfy each of the six categories of  core general education requirements. Also, a significant number of the  courses that satisfy the EIN requirement are taught by philosophers. In  the philosophy common room and on the department&rsquo;s  website, the department provides for each term a prospectus that  describes the special focus and the expected reading and writing for  each course and section. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  major in philosophy is highly recommended not only for those who wish  to pursue graduate study in philosophy but also as preparation for  other careers that require the ability to think in a creative and disciplined  manner about questions that are new or whose method of solution is  debated, including careers in law, theology, business, management,  medicine, journalism, politics, and education. </p>
              <p> Philosophy majors are encouraged to participate in the student-run Philosophy Forum, to attend special lectures and events sponsored by the department, to explore study abroad programs, and to participate in departmental social events. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> A  major in philosophy may be attained by completing the requirements for  either a regular major or a contract major. Most philosophy courses  simultaneously count toward the major and toward one or more general  education requirements. Because the philosophy major can be tailored to  the needs and goals of individual students, all philosophy majors are  encouraged to work closely with an advisor in the philosophy department. </p>
              <p> A regular major requires at least nine courses in philosophy, including Philosophy 235 (Ancient Philosophy),  Philosophy 236 (History of Modern Philosophy), Philosophy 240 (Formal  Logic), and three Level III seminar courses. These specifications seek  to first assure a major&rsquo;s grasp of the history and methods of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical inquiry. </p>
              <p> A contract major involves a contract drawn up between the student and the Department of Philosophy.  The contract combines seven courses in philosophy, including Philosophy  235 and 236, two Level III seminar courses, and either a logic project  or Philosophy 240, with three Level II or III courses in another  department chosen to complement the work in philosophy. </p>
              <p> These  requirements give students a great deal of leeway to pursue their own  interests. Those who wish to develop a balanced understanding of  philosophy should take a number of courses in each of the following categories: I. history of philosophy (118, 233, 235, 236, 251, 374); II. metaphysics and epistemology (231, 240, 241, 244, 371, 372); and III. ethics and value theory (119,  120, 147, 153, 243, 245, 250, 252, 254, 256, 257, 261, 373). Categories  for 375 and 399 vary year by year. It is also possible to specialize in one of these areas, but students are strongly encouraged to take at least one, and preferably two, courses in each of the areas outside their specialization. </p>
              <p> Students who complete the Great Conversation receive credit for one philosophy course toward the major. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> DISTINCTION </h5>
              <p> Departmental distinction in philosophy is awarded by a vote of the department to those graduating students  whose discourse, both oral and written, exhibits such  philosophical virtues as clarity, coherence, and sensitivity to  the full range of relevant considerations, fair-mindedness, rigor, and creativity. Candidates submit a portfolio of papers by April 15 to the department chair. Additional information about applying for distinction is available on the department&rsquo;s website and in the philosophy common room. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL RESOURCES </h5>
              <p> The  Howard and Edna Hong Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf is an  internationally acclaimed center for the study of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard,  the 19th-century Danish philosopher who is widely recognized as the  father of existentialism. The library offers a visiting fellows  program, and every year scholars from around the world come to do  research. It is an invaluable resource for students. A number of  philosophy students have worked in the library, and seniors and recent  graduates have participated in its fellowship program. The library  sponsors <em>The Reed</em>, an undergraduate journal of existential thought. </p>
              <p> The  Eunice Belgum Memorial Lectures are delivered annually by leading  philosophers from around the world. Recent lecturers include Bas van  Fraassen of Princeton University and Jonathan Lear of the University of  Chicago. The Belgum lecturer for 2006-07 was Galen Strawson from the  University of Reading and CUNY. Julia Anna (University of Arizona) is scheduled for 2007-08. </p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-119"></a>119 Moral Psychology</p>
<p>This seminar provides an introduction to psychology that focuses on psychological issues
related to moral behavior.  The course examines the nature of those states of mind that are
thought to constitute moral (or evil) character and produce moral (or evil) actions, relationships,
and societies.  States considered may include humility, self-respect, beneficence, compassion,
caring, anger, forgiveness, courage, and truthfulness.  Open to first-year students and sophomores
only.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-120"></a>120 Philosophy in Literature</p>
<p>Literature provides rich resources for thinking through central philosophical questions, including
the metaphysics and ethics of freedom, the problem of evil, the role of character in choice and
action, the nature of morality, rebellion and human solidarity, God's existence and relation to the
world, and the nature of truth.  Designed primarily for first-year students, this course explores
philosophical ideas in literary works of several different genres by studying plot, character,
point of view, imagery, and symbolism.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-147"></a>147 Death and the Meaning of Life</p>
<p>This course introduces philosophical ideas and methods through reading, discussing, and
writing about basic questions that arise when we reflect on the human condition. What is meant
by "meaning" when one asks whether (a person's) life has meaning? How do our beliefs
about human nature, religion and morality affect how we ask or answer the question? How does
our mortality affect our living? Classical and contemporary writings -- philosophical and
autobiographical -- are used. Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-231"></a>231 Philosophy of Mind</p>
<p>Is there anything about the human mind that cannot in principle be understood scientifically?  Are
we just complex physical machines?  This course looks at recent attempts to answer such questions.
Students examine the philosophical foundations of various approaches to the study of the mind and
consider the possible moral and social implications of these approaches with respect to questions
of free will, personal identity, and our responsibility for our actions.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-233"></a>233 Kierkegaard and Existentialism</p>
<p>An introduction to Kierkegaard's work and to existentialism, this course emphasizes the aesthetic,
ethical, and religious "stages on life's way."  Existential questions concerning the meaning of
human existence, passion and faith, freedom and choice, despair, and the absurd are examined.
Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-235"></a>235 Ancient Western Philosophy</p>
<p>This course surveys the origins and development of Western philosophy starting with the pre-
Socratics.  Students explore the historical foundations of natural science, metaphysics, and ethics
in the works of the pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics, usually
through primary texts.  The course concludes with a brief examination of some medieval attempts
to synthesize the Greek philosophical tradition and the Judeo-Christian religious heritage.

Students explore the historical foundations of central issues in metaphysics and epistemology in
the works of such thinkers as Descartes, Pascal, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley,
Hume, and Kant.  Topics may include conceptions of God, freedom, knowledge and skepticism,
the nature of ideas, and the foundations of modern science.  Prerequisite: One course in
philosophy or consent of instructor.  Offered every year.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-240"></a>240 Formal Logic and Philosophy</p>
<p>Formal systems of logic attempt to make principles of good reasoning explicit.  This course
introduces two such systems of logic: propositional and predicate calculus.  Students learn to
use formal techniques to analyze arguments and explore philosophical issues related to meta-
theory, including consistency and completeness, the paradoxes of material implication,
ontological commitment, and the interpretation of quantifiers.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-241"></a>241 Philosophical Theology</p>
<p>This course is a philosophical inquiry into the core commitments of Christian theism in the context
of other world religions and naturalism.  Central themes include beliefs about the existence and
nature of God, the doctrines of the trinity and incarnation, redemption and ritual, human free will
and responsibility, revelation and reason, religious experience, the problem of evil, different
views of life after death, miracles and historical inquiry, and religious pluralism.  Offered every
year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-243"></a>243 Aesthetics</p>
<p>Philosophers have long been interested in art: its nature, its value, its meaning, and the standards
by which it should be judged.  This course investigates those issues and others related to
creativity and the visual and other arts.  Students develop their appreciation and understanding of
the aesthetic properties of art by analyzing particular works in light of major texts in the
philosophy of art and art criticism.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-244"></a>244 Philosophy of Science</p>
<p>Using examples from the natural sciences, this course examines fundamental concepts of science,
including scientific method, the nature of scientific theories and hypotheses, objectivity in data
collection and analysis, the use of technology in making observations, confirmation versus
falsification, and explanation versus prediction.  To illustrate why non-scientists need to
understand scientific practice the course also considers controversies such as global warming
and intelligent design.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-245"></a>245 Philosophy and Feminism</p>
<p>Students examine feminist critiques of aspects of contemporary culture that shape women's
lives, such as conventional morality, science, education, art, medicine, law, religion, and
marriage.  Students critically examine philosophical views that underlie these institutions,
including views of human nature, gender, rationality, knowledge, morality, justice, and the
value of autonomy.  Alternative feminist views that promote feminist aims are explored and
evaluated.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-250"></a>250 Biomedical Ethics</p>
<p>This course clarifies central concepts and distinctions developed in the literature of moral
philosophy and applications of those concepts and distinctions to concrete moral problems that
arise in the practice of medicine. Issues may include euthanasia, abortion, medical paternalism,
allocation of scarce medical resources, culturally sensitive medical care, pandemics, and
conflicts of loyalty in managed care. Readings are drawn from both philosophical and medical
discussions.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-251"></a>251 Asian Philosophy</p>
<p>This course surveys the influential philosophical traditions of India and China. Students
explore the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism and Taoism and consider
other traditions with which they have interacted. Where appropriate, comparisons are drawn to
Western philosophical traditions.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-252"></a>252 Ethics and the Good Life</p>
<p>This course examines the main Western ethical theories and their application to contemporary
moral concerns.  Theoretical issues may include rights, duties, virtue, hedonism, egoism, the
relation between ethics and theology, the fact-value distinction, relativism, and pluralism.
Students discuss current topics such as global economic justice, euthanasia and the death
penalty, animal rights, censorship, racism, privacy rights versus public safety, reproductive
ethics, and environmental ethics.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-254"></a>254 Law, Politics, and Morality</p>
<p>This course considers the relationships between moral principles, law, and the practice of
governments.  Topics may include the "Just War" debate, censorship, property rights and
distributive justice, natural law, political liberalism and its critics, whether governments should
act in accordance with specific moral principles or remain neutral, the tensions between individual
rights and the good of the community, and the role of religion in public life.  Prerequisite:
completion of BTS-T.  Offered most years.</p>
<p></p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-256"></a>256 Friendship, Love, and the Good Life</p>
<p>Moral issues concerning friendship and love are analyzed from the perspective of normative
moral theories and various theories of value. Issues may include the role of friendship in  the
moral life, exploitative versus fulfilling relationships, and the conflict between altruism and
self-love. Since loving is itself a form of valuing, value theory is approached by investigating
philosophical and theological works concerning the basic types of love: <I>philia</I>, <I>eros</I>,
and <I>agape</I>.  Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T.  Offered most years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-257"></a>257 Environmental Ethics</p>
<p>Valuing nature raises significant philosophical and ethical issues. This course considers the
nature of animal life, the character and control of pollution, the conflict between preservationism
and conservationism, corporate and governmental responsibility for the eco-crisis, the use of
economic categories to assess wilderness areas and endangered species, the conflict between
eco-holism and individualism, and the philosophy of wilderness management.  Prerequisite:
completion of BTS-T.  Offered every year.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-261"></a>261 Freud and the Study of Human Behavior</p>
<p>Students examine Freud's thesis that our thoughts and actions spring from the darkness of our
unconscious. Because Freud based his theory on a small sample of case studies, the course
scrutinizes this qualitative data and discusses the role of case studies in the study of human
behavior. Students evaluate the criteria for a scientific theory of human behavior and consider
whether Freud's theory meets them.  Offered during Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"> 294 Academic Internship </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 298 Independent Study </p>

<p>Students examine contemporary approaches to classical issues in ethics and theory of value: the
nature of moral judgments; theories of moral obligation and value; the concept of moral
responsibility; and the relation of morality to science, religion, and law.  May be repeated if
topics are different.  Prerequisites: two courses in philosophy, one of which must be either 235 or
236, or permission of the department chair; completion of BTS-T.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="philosophy-374"></a>374 Studies in the History of Philosophy (Seminar)</p>
<p>Students consider a selected figure or movement from the history of philosophy.  May be
repeated if topics are different.  Prerequisites: two courses in philosophy, one of which must be
