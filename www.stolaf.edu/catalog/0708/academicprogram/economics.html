              <p> <span class="programdescription">The Department of Economics seeks to create a teaching and learning community that provides  students with varied opportunities for acquiring the necessary  knowledge, analytical skills, and judgment to prepare them for personal  and professional growth and for confident and responsible leadership in  a rapidly changing world. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  department encourages students: (1) to learn about the economic,  commercial and governmental institutions that serve the American and  international communities, (2) to be competent in economic and  statistical analysis, and (3) to be cognizant of historical, global and moral perspectives on economic and business issues. </p>

            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMICS PROGRAM </h5>
              <p> Economics  is the study of how people and organizations make decisions, how they  interact with each other, and how institutions and policies can be  designed to improve people&rsquo;s lives. The ambition of those who study  economics is to understand the world around them both as it is and as  it ought to be. The basic principles of economics are applied to a wide  range of social and political challenges that confront us today. These  include international trade, environmental protection, health care,  development, domestic taxes, Federal Reserve policies, labor  outsourcing, and the regulation of private business. </p>
              <p> The economics curriculum at St. Olaf includes theory, applications, institutional studies, and quantitative analysis. Where appropriate, economics courses also pursue historical and ethical concerns. </p>
              <p> The department offers areas of emphasis for its majors who desire more focused study in finance, management, international economics, and policy analysis. The department also supports several programs available  to students regardless of major: an interdisciplinary concentration in  management studies, the programs of the Finstad Office for  Entrepreneurial Studies, study abroad, and internship opportunities. </p>
              <p> The  economics major serves as excellent preparation for careers in a wide  variety of fields, including economic analysis, banking, accounting,  consulting, health administration, finance, business management,  teaching, and international affairs. The major also provides a solid  foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in  economics, business, public policy, and law. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> REQUIREMENTS OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p>Majors in economics must meet the  following minimum requirements: two courses in mathematics, (1) Mathematics 120, 121, or its equivalent, and (2) <em>either</em> a mathematics course  that has Mathematics 120 as a prerequisite <em>or </em>Economics 233; &nbsp;Economics 261 and 262; Statistics 263, or  Statistics 272 plus Economics 385; and at least four courses in economic  analysis.              </p>
              <p>                Economics 233 may substitute for the required second mathematics course only if it is completed  before both Economics 261 and 262 or before one of those courses and concurrently with the other. Economics 261 and 262, and Statistics 263, or Statistics 272 plus  Economics 385, cannot be taken S/U. The economics major requires four courses  in economic analysis with a minimum of one at Level II and two at Level III  unless the student completes an Area of Emphasis. Majors who also complete an  Area of Emphasis within the department must complete three additional courses  in economic analysis, at least one of which must be at Level III.              </p>
              <p> In the course of their studies, economics majors should also gain working knowledge of a statistical computing package, a text processor, and an electronic spreadsheet. </p>
              <p> Students  considering graduate work in economics are advised to take additional  courses in economic analysis (including Economics 385) and mathematics  (Mathematics 126 or 128, 220, 226, 230, and 244). </p>
            </div>

              <div>
                <h6> Areas of Emphasis </h6>
                <p> Areas  of emphasis provide the opportunity for economics majors to pursue a  more structured program of study beyond the normal major requirements.  The department offers two management studies areas of emphasis and two  economics areas of emphasis. Contracts for each area of emphasis must  be individually negotiated with the appropriate director before the end  of the student&rsquo;s junior year. Students may be certified in one management studies and one economics area of emphasis. </p>
                <p> Management studies areas of emphasis include finance and management. Each requires five management  studies courses including a Level III Management Studies course that  also satisfies one of the requirements for the economics major. A grade  of C or better must be earned in each of the five courses. </p>
                <p> The finance area of emphasis requires  Management Studies 225, either Management Studies 237 or 259,  Management Studies 281, plus two approved electives, at least one at  Level III. The management area of emphasis requires  Management Studies 225, Management Studies 237, Management Studies 251,  plus two approved electives, at least one at Level III. </p>
                <p> The international economic analysis and policy area of emphasis requires Economics 382 (International  Economics); two Level II international-related courses chosen from the following: Economics  218, 238 and 243, and ID 249; and one elective outside the department that has an  international emphasis, such as a course taken abroad. </p>
                <p> The public policy area of emphasis includes  Economics 371 (Economics of Public Policy) and two economics analysis  courses chosen from the following list: Economics 242, 244, 245, 249  and 385. </p>
                <p> A  grade of C or above is required for all courses in the area of  emphasis. The Level III course for either area of emphasis may also be  counted toward the economics major. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> CONCENTRATIONS AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> The  Economics Department participates in international studies programs and  encourages its majors to take advantage of study in other countries.  The department also participates in several interdisciplinary majors  and concentrations, including American studies, Asian studies,  management studies, Hispanic studies, statistics, environmental  studies, women&rsquo;s studies, and the social studies education major. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> COURSES </h5>
              <p class="goldsubhead"> INTRODUCTORY COURSES </p>
              <p> Courses  numbered 110-120 all present a common core of economic principles, and  therefore credit will be given for only one of these courses. Courses  numbered 110-120 cannot be taken after taking Economics 121.  Students may only take one course from among 110-120; none of these  courses may be repeated. </p>
              <p class="coursename"> 110-120 Gateways to Economics</p>
              <p> These  classes introduce first-year students to principles of economics  through special topics. Each course emphasizes the application of  economic concepts to topics of general interest, capitalizing on the  special interests and expertise of the faculty. A list of topics and  course descriptions will be included with registration materials each semester. These courses are open only to first-year students. </p>
              <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-111"></a>111 Gateways to Economics: Transition Economies</p>
<p>At one time, roughly one-third of the world's population lived in countries with centrally planned
socialist economies.  The world has witnessed a series of astonishing transitions as these planned
economies moved to introduce market reforms.  This course introduces and applies the basic tools of
economic analysis to understand and explore the transitions taking place in these countries.  The
course focuses principally on China and Russia but will include examples drawn from Eastern Europe
and Cuba.  Offered many Interims.</p>

              <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-113"></a>113 Gateways to Economics: Capitalism</p>
<p>This course uses major schools of economic thought and major economic writers from the past 600
years to introduce principles of economics.  Readings include the architects of capitalism (Adam
Smith, David Ricardo, etc.), the critics (Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblem, etc.), and the reformers
(J.M. Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter, J.K. Galbraith, etc.).  Offered many Interims.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-115"></a>115 Gateways to Economics: Globalization and Poverty</p>
<p>Vigorous debates about globalization and poverty have circulated in the media for the past decade,
gaining international attention as protests interrupted the 1990 WTO Ministerial Conference in
Seattle.  This course introduces economic principles and uses them to evaluate thoughts on
globalization, trade, growth, and poverty as articulated by economists like John Maynard Keynes,
Friedrich von Hayek, Joseph Stiglitz, Jagdish Bhagwati, Jeffrey Sachs, and William Easterly, and as
enacted by institutions like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank.  Offered in Interim.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-116"></a>116 Gateways to Economics: Consumers in Families and Communities</p>
<p>Consumers, families, and community are intertwining elements of the social economy, each
depending on the others for success.  This course focuses on the triad, highlighting economic
roles and principles.  Among the topics of interest are the "rational consumer," saving and
investing, momentous decisions, prodigal behavior, consumer protection, group dynamics,
nurturing manipulation, collective purchases, budgeting, voting, and social welfare.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-121"></a>121 Principles of Economics</p>
<p>This course takes an analytical approach to economic reasoning and contemporary issues.  The
course introduces microeconomic and macroeconomic theories with applications to relevant topics,

<p>Game theory is the formal study of the strategic interactions between individuals and between groups
of individuals.  Game theory has become a widely adopted tool of analysis in economics, business,
law, politics, anthropology, sociology, and international relations.  This course introduces
students to the theoretical constructs of game theory and focuses on economic applications in the
fields of labor economics, international trade, environmental economics, macroeconomics, and
industrial organization.  Prerequisite: one of Economics 110-121, or permission of instructor.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-242"></a>242 Environmental Economics</p>
<p>The powerful insights of microeconomic analysis inform this consideration of environmental
policy and regulation.  Coursework emphasizes issues germane to setting and attaining specific
environmental objectives - how much pollution to allow, how much to encourage preservation, how
much cutting to permit.  By considering whether and how to assign monetary values to goods
like species diversity and climactic stability, students gain practical experience applying
benefit-cost analysis to environmental decisions. Prerequisite: one of Economics 110-121 or
permission of instructor. Offered most years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-243"></a>243 Economic Development</p>

110-121 or permission of instructor.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-245"></a>245 Economics of Health Care</p>
<p>The health care sector in the U.S. is undergoing rapid change which affects patients,
providers and payers. Managed care and managed competition are restructuring the delivery of
health care services and reducing costs, while frustrating physicians and patients. The course
examines the economic factors leading to the changes, current issues and controversies, and
federal health policies. Students from nursing, pre-med and the sciences are encouraged to
enroll. Prerequisites: one of Economics 110-121 or permission of instructor.  Offered most years.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-247"></a>247 History of Economic Thought</p>

              <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-371"></a>371 Economics of Public Policy</p>
<p>Government action affects us all. We pay taxes; we use public roads, schools, and parks. Some
prices we pay are lower due to government subsidies; others are higher due to taxes.  Government
actions influence both the efficiency of our economy and the equity and equality within our
society.  Students learn valuable analytical tools for evaluating public projects, tax policies,
entitlement programs and voting behavior. Prerequisite: Economics 262, Statistics 263 or Statistics
272, or permission of instructor and completion of BTS-T.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-374"></a>374 Money and Banking</p>
<p>This course addresses the institutions that comprise modern monetary systems and the influence that
these systems have on levels of income, output, employment, and prices in market economies.
Monetary theory and monetary policy, including both the nature of our central bank and the role
that it plays in our monetary system, are also addressed in some detail.  Prerequisite: Economics
262 and Statistics 263 or Statistics 272, or permission of instructor.  Offered annually.</p>

 <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-376"></a>376 Labor Economics and Employment Relations</p>
<p>What do workers want from work? What do employers want from workers? Pressing policy issues
