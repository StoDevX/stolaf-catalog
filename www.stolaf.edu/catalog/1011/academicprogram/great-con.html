              <p> <span class="programdescription">An integrated sequence of five courses taken over two years, the Great Conversation introduces students to the major epochs of Western tradition through direct encounter with significant works. Beginning with the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, the program traces the development  of literary and artistic expression, philosophic thought, religious  belief, and historical reflections on Western culture into the modern  world. Students respond to great works, challenging  the ideas expressed in them and challenging their own ideas as well,  thus joining the conversation of men and women through the ages about  the perennial issues of human life. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  Great Conversation is open to students of all interests. This program  appeals to those who like to read, discuss, and write about ideas;  those who believe that learning about the past is profoundly relevant  to understanding the present; those who want to examine the Western  tradition in a unified way; and those who believe that an education  ought to cultivate discriminating minds, inquisitive spirits, and moral sensitivity. </p>
              <p><span class="programdescription"> The  faculty members who teach a Great Conversation cohort remain with the  students through the courses in the standard sequence (113-218), as  fellow participants in the conversation. Students in the Great Conversation live in the same residence hall their first year and enjoy eating meals together, attending films and theater, and going on field trips throughout the program. </span></p>
