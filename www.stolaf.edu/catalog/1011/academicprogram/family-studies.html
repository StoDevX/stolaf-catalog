              <p class="programdescription"> The well-being of individuals and families is  a national  and global concern, and the family as a focus for study in higher education  has increased in significance. Since many disciplines  contribute to the understanding of families, family studies is an  integrative field that synthesizes knowledge from liberal arts  disciplines, particularly biology, psychology, social work, sociology, and political  science. </p>
              <p class="programdescription">Family studies offers a major to students through the class of 2011. Students in the class of 2012 and later have the opportunity for a concentration in family studies.</p>

              <p class="body"> The  family studies major provides academic linkages across disciplines  based in the liberal arts. The major supports the college&rsquo;s emphases on  cross-cultural and experiential learning. In preparation for graduate-level work and professional career opportunities, a research course  assists students to evaluate and critique research. The core courses  introduce students to the field of family studies and explore issues,  strengths, and roles within the family life span and the varied  dimensions of human sexuality and interpersonal experience. Lastly,  students explore special topics which focus on the explanation of  research and the connections between various disciplines in the study of families. </p>

The senior capstone experience results in a product or project that involves working with real families. It could be a panel or talk organized by the student(s), a pamphlet, a web site, a portfolio, an integrative paper, or another approved project.

This concentration is intended to help to prepare students entering careers with families including marriage and family therapy, education, and ministry, or to family practice in law, medicine, nursing, social work, or public policy. Students who intend to go directly to graduate school should also consider enrollment in a statistics course and a research methods course in social work, psychology, or sociology.</p>
