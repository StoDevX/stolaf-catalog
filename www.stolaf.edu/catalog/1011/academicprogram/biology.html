              <p> <span class="programdescription">From  the molecules that are the building blocks of life to the complex  interactions between living beings and their environments, biology  continues to fascinate the human mind. The Biology Department offers a  diverse array of courses and experiences that present fundamental  biological principles and processes within the context of being  informed, responsible, and compassionate citizens. It provides a broad  range of learning opportunities through its course offerings,  laboratories, independent study/research, internships and off-campus  study programs  at sites including South India, the desert southwest, Costa Rica, Australia,  Bahamas, Galapagos Islands, and Northern Minnesota. Woven into all  learning opportunities are hands-on experiences with modern equipment that stimulate critical and independent thinking. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> For  science majors, the Biology Department offers an exciting slate of  challenging and rewarding courses. For the less science-oriented  student, it seeks to stimulate natural curiosity about how our bodies  work and how humans interact with their surroundings by providing  several courses designed primarily for non-science majors. These  courses, which satisfy the  natural sciences (SED, IST) requirements of  the general education curriculum, focus on current biological issues and general interest topics in biology. </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  ever-broadening nature of biology requires diversely-trained and  inquisitive biologists. The biology major has the dual mission of  introducing students to the information and technological tools of  various disciplines of biology while instilling the confidence to  critically assess a biological phenomenon and to design and carry out  an appropriate research program. To that end, the biology major provides the  necessary content and instrument training while students practice the  art of scientific inquiry. Opportunities for interdisciplinary work abound. Biology majors are encouraged to participate  in research with faculty, off-campus programs in biology, in  departmental seminars and social activities. </p>
        </div>
            <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/biology.htm">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJOR</a></h5>

              <p> <span class="body">Research  opportunities are central to the teaching mission of the Biology  Department. In addition to independent research  and  project-based courses (Biology 396 or 398), each summer the Biology Department awards  several paid research positions to students interested in working with  faculty on current research projects. These ten-week positions,  supported by outside funding, offer excellent opportunities in both  lab and field research. Biology 291: <em>Topics - Research</em>  is a quarter-credit opportunity for a journal club or other exploratory course offered at student request and the professor's discretion. </span></p>
              <p><span class="body"> The Biology Department offers many opportunities for off-campus study. Two semester-long programs, Biology in South India (offered every fall semester) and Environmental Science in Australia (offered alternating  spring semesters), are of particular interest to biology students.  Other semester/summer programs are available through affiliated  institutions or programs (e.g., ACM Oak Ridge Science Semester, ACM  Tropical Field Research, Coe College Wilderness Field Station,  Denmark&rsquo;s International Studies Program).  In addition, each interim several off-campus biology courses are  offered. Off-campus interim courses may include Desert Biology  (Arizona), Winter Ecology (Northern Minnesota), Island Biology  (Bahamas), Tropical Ecology (Costa Rica),   Equatorial Biology (Ecuador, Galapagos Islands) and Peruvian Medical Experience (Peru). Students  interested in off-campus biology courses should consult biology faculty or the Office of International and Off-Campus Studies.</span> </p>
