              <p class="programdescription"> The  Asian Studies Department provides students with the opportunity to  study East Asia,  Southeast Asia, and South Asia. The department offers  an Asian studies major and concentrations in Asian studies, China studies, and Japan studies. A concentration in Asian studies &mdash;  which presumes that a student completes a major in another department &mdash;  is ideal for students with an interest in Asia who are majoring in  economics, history, religion, anthropology,  art, political science, or other areas. St. Olaf offers many  international programs in Asia. The concentrations in China and Japan  studies allow students to pursue advanced language study with or without an Asian studies major. </p>

              <p class="goldhead">overview of the major</p>
              <p class="body">The Asian studies major allows students to gain competence in either Chinese or Japanese language and the understanding of Asian societies through a selection of courses in languages, linguistics, literature, film, economics, history, religion, art history, political science, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, as well as special interdisciplinary courses on Asia. Courses that count toward the major are listed under Asian Studies, Chinese, Japenese, Asian Conversations, and other departments (listed at the end of this catalog section). Many Asian studies courses also fulfill one or more general education requirements. Asian studies majors are encouraged to use their language skills to experience an Asian culture firsthand through study in Asia. Level I courses provide introductions to the languages and the fields of Asian studies. Level II courses, including the Asian Conversations program, provide students a breadth of knowledge about Asia or intermediate study of language. Level III courses offer students the opportunity to do advanced study on a topic about Asia.</p>
