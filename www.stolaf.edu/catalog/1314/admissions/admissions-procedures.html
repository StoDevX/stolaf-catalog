            <p class="programname">Admissions
              Procedures            </p>
            <p><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/">http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/</a> </p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>St. Olaf College seeks to assemble a student body that reflects a variety of geographic, cultural, socio-economic, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. Each class reflects the college's commitment to enrolling a diverse and energetic group of students eager to embrace the challenges of a liberal arts education. Admissions decisions take into consideration academic achievement and aptitude,  personal qualifications, evidence of service and leadership, and significant involvement in school and community. </em></p>
            <p class="faculty"><em>If you have questions about the application process, please contact the Admissions Office at 800-800-3025.  </em></p>
            <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDED PREPARATION </p>
              <p class="body">A secondary school program combining breadth and depth is an excellent preparation for study at St. Olaf. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Cambridge A level, or accelerated and enriched coursework, when available, are particularly helpful. St. Olaf recommends a program of study that includes the following: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body"> Four years of English;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of mathematics;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of natural science;</li>
                <li class="body"> Three to four years of social studies; and</li>
                <li class="body"> Two to four years of the same second language, including
                          study in the senior year.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="body">Successful applicants to St. Olaf have pursued an academically rigorous high school program that emphasizes creativity, writing, and critical analysis. Analytic and quantitative skills  are important for all students. In addition,  students are encouraged  to take academic electives such as computer science, economics, the fine arts, geography, journalism, sociology, speech, and world history. Keyboarding, word processing, health, and physical education, while valued, are not acceptable substitutes for academic subjects. </p>
        <p class="body">Careful attention is given to each application, and explanation of special circumstances are encouraged. St. Olaf offers a variety of courses designed to meet the diverse needs, interests and qualifications of new students. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">Application Requirements </p>
              <p class="body">Each application for admission is reviewed on its own merit. Applicants to St. Olaf must submit: </p>
              <ol>
                <li class="body">A $40 application fee (waived if the application is completed online). </li>

              <p class="goldhead">COLLEGE ENTRANCE TESTS </p>
              <p class="body">The single most important academic factor for applicants to St. Olaf is the record of achievement reflected in the candidate's high school transcript. Standardized test results are  important, but a secondary, factor.

High school counseling/guidance offices have information on the tests, test dates, testing centers, and registration procedures. </p>
              <p class="goldhead">TYPES OF APPLICATION </p>
              <p class="body">Two types of application are available to students:   Early Decision and Regular Decision              </p>
