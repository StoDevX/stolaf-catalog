            <p class="programname">Pre-Professional Programs</p>
        <p class="body">The following roster of pre-professional studies indicates how the liberal arts can fulfill the general as well as the specialized objectives of St. Olaf students. Recommendations are based on the typical pre-professional requirements currently existing in universities and professional schools. </p>
            <p class="body">Many other occupations beyond those in this roster may be pursued with a liberal arts background, of course. To learn more about them, call or visit the campus contact persons listed in areas that seem similar. </p>
            <p class="body">Subjects grouped under the headings &ldquo;Strongly Recommended&rdquo; are required by many institutions while those under &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; are important but not necessarily required. Because of their diverse nature, many professions such as business and management, law, and public policy defy course-specific recommendations for undergraduates. For example, as many psychology as economics majors in the United States enter business careers each year through corporate training programs. In those instances, recommendations should be considered suggestive, not directive. Opposite examples are <a href="../academicprogram/nursing.html">nursing</a> and <a href="../academicprogram/social-work.html">social work</a>, which have prescribed curriculums required for licensure examinations. </p>
        <p class="body">Students are encouraged to work closely with faculty, pre-professional advisors, department chairs, and the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/">Piper Center for Vocation and Career</a> during and after their time at St. Olaf. </p>

        <p class="body">Students planning to sit for the CPA examination upon graduation should major in economics or mathematics and take elective courses in accounting and finance. New members of the American Institute of CPAs are required to earn one year of college credit beyond the bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students are strongly advised to check the regulations for licensure in the state where they intend to practice. </p>
            <p align="left" class="body"><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> Management Studies 225, 237, 250, 251, 252, 281, and 380; Mathematics 126 </p>

            <p class="body">Career paths in architecture include graduate professional programs toward becoming a licensed architect, teaching architecture and/or architectural history, and involvement in many fields of design, from environmental work, urban design, and landscape architecture, to interior and furnishings design. A studio art major and courses in art and architectural history are recommended. Because architecture requires a comprehensive understanding of culture, it is important to have a background in municipal organization, literature, writing and presenting ideas, aesthetics, logical and ethical problem solving, collaborative work and research, and environmental sustainability, as well as in mathematics and physics.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> A major in the visual arts with an emphasis in sculpture, painting, architectural drawing, and digital media (Art 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 228, and 239); a strong background in art history (Art 150, 251, 252, 262, 263 and 271); and strong background in mathematics (Calculus I and II and Physics 124 and 125). An option exists for a customized major via the Center for Integrated Studies.</p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Recommended: </strong>Courses in American and European history, American and/or urban studies, literature (especially with advanced writing components), and philosophy; social science courses; and at least one ORC-designated course </p>

        <p class="body">The best Masters of Business Administration (MBA) programs do not require a specific undergraduate curriculum.

            <p class="body">Computer science remains at the heart of preparation for careers or graduate study in computer engineering (which focuses on hardware design) and software engineering, since computer science provides a conceptual foundation for computing disciplines. The emphasis on &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; learning techniques, professionalism, and computing ethics and on the development of communication and leadership skills in St. Olaf&rsquo;s computer science major program give a further preparatory boost to future engineers. The following courses are particularly recommended. </p>

          <p>Pre-health studies are a roadmap through the liberal arts that begins with your admission to college, and ends with your admission to a health professional school (such as a medical school). At St. Olaf College, this route intersects with our commitment (as stated in the Mission Statement) to an education that fosters critical thinking, heightens moral sensitivity, promotes lives of unselfish service to others and challenges you to become responsible, knowledgeable citizens of the world. Pre-health studies are supported by the dedication and efforts of the faculty of the Health Professions Committee and the staff of The Piper Center for Vocation and Career.</p>

          <h5>OVERVIEW OF PRE-HEALTH STUDIES</h5>
          <p>The following information is intended for St. Olaf students who are in the process of deciding what path their future career will take in the health professions. There are many health careers in addition to human and veterinary medicine, dentistry and nursing. Some of these areas are listed below, along with the HPC member with advising expertise in that area:</p>

          <h5>PREREQUISITES FOR PRE-MEDICAL, PRE-DENTAL, PRE-PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT AND PRE-PODIATRY STUDENTS</h5>
          <p>Each medical school (whether MD or DO), dental school and physician's assistant program differs somewhat in their exact list of courses required for admission. However, St. Olaf's&nbsp;<a href="../academiclife/ba-gen-ed-requirements.html">general education curriculum</a>&nbsp;provides you with most of the non-science prerequisites typical of these programs. The following &quot;required&quot; courses are recommended for all students planning on entering medical schools (either MD or DO) or dental schools.</p>
          <p>Required:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Math 120:&nbsp;<em>Calculus</em></li>
            <li>2 semesters of general biology (typically Biology 150 and Biology 227)</li>
            <li>Chemistry 125 and Chemistry 126 (or Chemistry/Biology 125 and Chemistry/Biology 126)
              <ul>
                <li>Math 120 is a prerequisite for Chemistry 126 and Chemistry/Biology 126</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Chemistry 247 and Chemistry 248:&nbsp;<em>Organic Chemistry</em></li>
            <li>Chemistry 379:&nbsp;<em>Biochemistry</em>&nbsp;(organic chemistry is a prerequisite)</li>
            <li>Physics 124 and Physics 125</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Pre-medical students planning on taking the MCAT in 2015 or later years are also recommended to take:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Psychology 125</li>
            <li>A sociology course (121 is open to first-year students only)</li>
            <li>A statistics course (typically Statistics 212)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Pre-medical students should note that there is much more to being a competitive candidate for medical school than course planning. A competitive candidate to medical school might have a GPA of greater than 3.5, an MCAT score of greater than 30, significant experience with patients in a medical setting, and long-term volunteer experience (especially working with the underserved).</p>
          <p>Pre-dental students should note that many dental schools recommend that students take a semester of introductory psychology, a semester of statistics and coursework in studio art in addition to the required natural science and mathematics coursework above.</p>
          <p>Prererequisites for podiatry programs are similar to those for medical school, and some podiatry schools may accept the MCAT, DAT or GRE. A student who will use the MCAT when applying to podiatry school should take courses in psychology, sociology and statistics in addition to the required natural science and mathematics courses recommended for pre-medical students. Note, however, that psychology, sociology and statistics are not typically required for admission to podiatry programs.</p>
          <p>Prerequisites for Physician's Assistant programs are similar, but students should note that these programs may not require organic chemistry, biochemistry or physics; however, these students are also recommended to take:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Psychology 125 (introductory) and Psychology 241 (developmental psychology)</li>
            <li>Medical terminology (typically as Biology 291:&nbsp;<em>Medical Terminology</em>)</li>
            <li>A course emphasizing speech and communication</li>
            <li>Biology 143 and Biology 243 (2 sem sequence of Human Anatomy and Physiology)</li>
            <li>A statistics course</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY</h5>
          <p>Health Professionals graduate schools (such as medical schools) are looking for well-rounded individuals who are interested in a wide variety of areas and have demonstrated their interest in both medicine and people. Students should take advantage of the many opportunities to obtain patient contact and observe practitioners at work in their field of expertise. Medically-related experience is essential to successful application to many health profession programs; medical schools strongly recommend potential applicants obtain medically related work or other contact with patients, and physician assistant programs often require as many as 1500-2000 hours of work with patients before the student submits an application. The Piper Center's coaches and peer advisors can assist students in arranging internships with physicians in their hometown, with alumni or with healthcare professionals in the Twin Cities. Internships during the interim and summer of the students' sophomore or junior year work well. Students may also shadow healthcare professionals during the summer, or work in a hospital, clinic or nursing home (e.g., as a CNA); note that formal registration for credit is&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;required.</p>
          <p>Students should also maintain a high level of involvement in extra-curricular activities. They should select and involve themselves in activities of genuine interest. Extensive involvement in a few activities ranging from music to athletics to clubs (such as the pre-medical or pre-dental club) can demonstrate and develop valued traits such as dedication, commitment, leadership, perseverance and professionalism.</p>
          <p>Health professions schools are also interested in students who have demonstrated compassion and empathy through volunteer activities. Examples of volunteer activity include hospice programs, home health aid, crisis-line counseling, working with physically disabled or developmentally delayed individuals, working with abuse victims or with trouble youth. Volunteering, like shadowing and other forms of health care exposure, will enhance the student's goal orientation and assist them in focusing on their goals. Long periods of service involvement are preferred to brief stints in many activities.</p>
