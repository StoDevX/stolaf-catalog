            <p class="programname">Academic Resources</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Office of the registrAR and Academic Advising</p>
            <p class="programdescription">Academic advising at St. Olaf College encourages the integration of the mind, body, and spirit as students learn to create academic, career, and lifelong goals. Students discover how to direct their intellectual curiosity, to overcome personal or academic barriers to learning, and to pursue their goals. Central to this educational process is the collaboration between students and their faculty advisors. </p>
            <p class="subhead">Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising</p>
            <p class="body">The <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/">Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising</a> provides administrative and curricular support to all St. Olaf students and faculty advisors. The center provides high quality, timely service on routine and general academic curricular questions and encourages all students to become more knowledgeable and involved in planning their academic programs. </p>
            <p class="body">During the regular academic year, students may make appointments with staff members of the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising. Individual advising, plust forms related to to adding and dropping courses, s/u changes, faculty advisors, academic programs, regulations, transcripts, registration, transfer work, petitions, and other daily matters are available at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/">Web site </a>or window. Contact information: phone (507) 786-3015, fax (507) 786-3074, email: <a href="mailto: registrar@stolaf.edu">registrar@stolaf.edu</a></p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Academic Peer Advisors</strong> are a select group of current St. Olaf College students who assist in providing quality, timely service on routine and general academic curricular questions. They enable their peers to become more knowledgeable and involved in planning their academic programs. Academic Peer Advisors also assist with academic planning sessions during Week One (new student orientation), set up academic planning sessions during the year, provide support during registration times, and assist the Assistant Registrar, Academic Advising, Transfer Credit, and the First-Year Experience as needed.</p>
            <p class="subhead">Advisors</p>
            <p class="body">The<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/"> Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising </a>assigns a faculty advisor to each student. After completing at least one semester, all students may change to a different faculty advisor at any time during the academic year, with the permission of the new advisor via a change of advisor form. The Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising and the department chairs and program directors oversee the reassignment of advisees for faculty on sabbaticals or other leaves. Generally speaking, no individual faculty member has more than 25 to 30 advisees in any given year.</p>
            <p class="body">The advice of faculty advisors does not constitute a promise or a contract ensuring a student&rsquo;s graduation on schedule or the completion of specific requirements. Students and faculty advisors must refer to the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">class and lab schedules</a> to determine which courses fulfill specific graduation requirements. The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student. Students have access to their academic records at any time on St. Olaf&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/sis">Student Information System (S.I.S</a>). </p>

This   brings the total number of computers available for student use to nearly   900, or a student-computer ratio of just under 3:1. Multimedia editing   facilities are also available. </p>
        <p class="body">Nearly all of the St. Olaf faculty rely on some   form of computing technology in their teaching, be it podcasts, personal   response systems, Moodle, or video production. All college classrooms   are equipped with appropriate technologies. </p>

        <p class="body">IT employs 25 full-time professionals and   nearly 70 student employees who support the computing needs of the   entire campus. A campus help desk and student computing consultants are   available nearly 95 hours per week during the academic year, including   assistance in the evenings.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="goldhead">St. Olaf&rsquo;s Libraries and Special Collections</p>
        <p class="body">The St. Olaf Libraries provide a variety of carefully selected resources that mirror the breadth and depth of the undergraduate curriculum. These resources are housed in three branches: R&oslash;lvaag Library (the &quot;main&quot; library), Halvorson Music Library, and Hustad Science Library. The libraries subscribe to thousands of print and electronic periodicals and are a partial depository for federal government publications, core disciplinary journals and hundreds of scholarly online databases and archival collections to support academic and curricular research.</p>
        <p class="body">The strength of the St. Olaf collection is magnified through our partnership with the Carleton College Library via the Bridge consortium which offers a joint catalog of over 1.3 million  items, including physical and online video and audio recordings and digital resources. In addition, both schools have recently implemented Bridge&sup2;, a web discovery tool that provides access to over a billion  regional, national and international academic resources. Strong relationships with national library consortia provide extensive delivery of items via interlibrary-loan.</p>
        <p class="body"> While the Bridge consortium provides the fundamental resources for undergraduate research, it also has a number of unusual strengths. St. Olaf College has  especially strong holdings in the fields of music, Nordic history and literature, Norwegian American culture and church life.  The St. Olaf Libraries digitize and make freely available unique local publications such as the <em>Manitou Messenger</em>, the <em>Viking Yearbook</em>, and other works of historical significance to St. Olaf College.</p>
        <p class="body">The St. Olaf Libraries offer a course-integrated instruction program that teaches students to conduct research in a wide range of disciplines. In a typical academic week, the libraries provide 60 hours of research assistance at the reference desk. The libraries are open 110 hours per week when class is in session, with extended hours late in the semester and during exams. Twenty-six staff and more than 100 students purchase, organize, and make available a rich blend of materials and service points.</p>
<p class="subhead">Kierkegaard Library</p>
        <p class="body">The Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library, located within the R&oslash;lvaag Library building, is  the major research collection outside of Denmark for the study of the thought of the Danish philosopher, S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard. The library was presented to St. Olaf College in 1976 by the Hongs, who gathered the collection to support their translation into English of the complete works of Kierkegaard, published in 26 volumes by Princeton University Press. The Library is directed by Professor Gordon Marino, a Kierkegaard specialist and professor in the Philosophy Department. Especially during the summer, the library offers programs that bring students and visiting scholars together for research seminars and private study as well as study of Danish for the purpose of reading Kierkegaard texts in the original language. More than 50 scholars a year come to the Library from all over the U.S. and around the world. The collection includes 12,000 book volumes as well as 5,000 periodical and newspaper articles, non-print media, and archival materials. The collection is open Monday-Friday 9:00 a.m-5:00 p.m.  during the academic year, with extended hours in the summer months. Access to the collection at other times is available by appointment. The collection is open to anyone with interest in the study of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard, including St. Olaf and Carleton students, faculty, scholars, pastors, and other visitors. For further information, consult the Kierkegaard Library website at <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/">www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard</a>.</p>
        <p class="subhead">College Archives</p>
        <p class="body">Located in the R&oslash;lvaag Library Building, the Shaw-Olson Center for College History contains official records and publications, private papers, photographs, books, periodicals, audio and visual recordings, and museum artifacts that record and illustrate the history and life of the college. These materials provide historical information about the Board of Regents, the faculty, the student body, alumni, academic departments, the curriculum, administrative offices, campus services, college organizations, and campus activities. The mission of the archives is 1) to preserve materials that reflect the college&rsquo;s identity; 2) to make these materials available to scholars, students, alumni, and other interested researchers; and 3) to promote attention to the college's history. The collection may be searched electronically with <em>Fram</em> at <a href="http://fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/">http://fusion.stolaf.edu/archives/</a>. <em>Fram</em> identifies paper records and artifacts, indexes abstracts of all articles in the student newspaper, <em><a href="http://fusion.stolaf.edu/messenger/">The Manitou Messenger</a></em>, and provides full text searching for the St. Olaf magazine. The Center for College History  also provides work  opportunities for some students and occasional internships for majors in appropriate departments and programs. </p>
        <p class="subhead">The Norwegian-American Historical Association</p>
        <p class="body">Housed in the R&oslash;lvaag Library Building, the Norwegian-American Historical Association (NAHA) has been sheltered by St. Olaf since its founding in 1925. With an international membership of over 1,000, NAHA has two goals: to publish scholarly books on Norwegian-American history (106 books have been published so far) and to be a national center for research in Norwegian-American history by collecting and maintaining printed and manuscript materials produced by Norwegian-Americans or concerning their history. Printed materials, including periodicals and newspapers, are incorporated in the college library collection and other materials (such as diaries, journals, photographs and records of organizations) in a separate archive. The oldest, out of print publications are available on the NAHA website at: <em><a href="http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/">www.naha.stolaf.edu</a>. </em>Both students and the public are invited to use this center for research in Norwegian migration. </p>

        <p class="coursename"><span class="goldhead">Student Support Services</span> <span class="goldsubhead">(TR</span><span class="gold"><strong>i</strong></span><span class="goldsubhead"><strong>O</strong>)</span></p>
        <p class="body">Student Support Services (SSS)  is a  student retention program sponsored by St.  Olaf College with substantial support from the U.S. Department of Education,   the National Science Foundation Northstar STEM Alliance, Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation, and the Hearst Endowment. The SSS  program is one of three TRIO programs originally funded under the Higher  Education Act of 1965, whose objective is to help students overcome class,  social, and cultural barriers to complete their college education. SSS provides  the following services: academic advising/referral; cultural events and  leadership activities; financial aid advising; graduate school preparation;  incentive program for academic achievement; research, internship and  scholarship application assistance; supplemental instruction (SI); and a  graphing calculator lending program. </p>
        <p class="body">To be eligible for services, a participant must be a first-generation college student (neither parent has a four-year degree),  meet federal income guidelines, and/or have a documented disability. The SSS program provides services to approximately 160 eligible St. Olaf students annually. In order to apply for the program, students should contact Student Support Services, 507-786-8018. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">Other ACADEMIC support</p>
        <p class="subhead"> Class Attendance</p>
        <p class="body">Class attendance is expected and usually required. Irregular class attendance becomes the concern of the college since absence from class represents an academic loss. Excessive or prolonged absences are reported by instructors to the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/stulife/deanofstudents/">Dean of Students Office</a>. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Study Time and Study Habits</p>
        <p class="body">Many students need to adjust their time use habits on arrival at college. St. Olaf students are expected to devote a minimum of three hours of study outside of class for each hour in class. Making the best use of the limited time available usually requires using a good mix of daylight and evening hours for studying and avoiding study marathons. Successful study at St. Olaf usually includes reading ahead, attending class, using faculty office hours, studying for each class in frequent, short study sessions, attending help sessions, forming a study group, asking questions soon after they arise, and seeking help if the preceding efforts do not appear to be working. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Faculty Office Hours</p>
        <p class="body">Professors hold office hours for the classes they teach. Office hours are regular times set aside each week to talk with students from class, usually on a walk-in basis. Office hours provide an opportunity to ask questions about class topics, to extend the class discussion, or to get to know instructors better. St. Olaf faculty encourage students to avail themselves of this opportunity. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Help Sessions</p>
        <p class="body">Many departments hold special help sessions or discussion groups for particular courses. These are usually listed on syllabi for those courses and are usually staffed with upperclass students who have been successful in the course. These sessions may offer an opportunity to get a second look at the class material, to rehearse the ideas and vocabulary, and to ask questions. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Study Groups</p>
        <p class="body">Most students find it helpful in at least some of their courses to form a study group of two to three interested classmates. Such groups often improve understanding of course material through discussing assignments, exploring course ideas further, brainstorming possible test questions for each other or formulating questions to bring up in class. </p>
        <p class="subhead">Continuous Reporting System</p>
        <p class="body">Instructors are required to file a continuous reporting form that alerts the  Dean of Students Office to students who are having difficulties in a course. </p>
