            <p class="programname">International
                and 
              Domestic Off-Campus Studies: Global Perspective </p>
            <p class="body"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/international/">http://www.stolaf.edu/international/</a> </p>
            <p class="body">&ldquo;Global Perspective&rdquo; &mdash; The
                term comes up again and again when St. Olaf students and faculty
                talk about the lessons they have learned while studying on international
            and domestic off-campus programs. </p>
            <p class="body"> They&rsquo;re talking about the kind of exciting
                insights they received when Greek architecture, the Hindu caste system or political struggles around the world came to life before their eyes;
                when their biology or chemistry laboratory moved to a rain forest,
                or a desert; or, when everyday and utterly familiar
                things like eating breakfast or taking a bath were put into thought-provoking
              new contexts. </p>
            <p class="body">The objective of all off-campus programs is to  provide students with the opportunity to engage in cross-cultural learning.  Students gain knowledge and awareness of cultures other than their own and  reflect on their own culture through the lens of this new perspective. Experiential learning, however, can take many forms. Often it involves the study of history, religion, politics, economics, art, and other aspects of social life. In many programs it also extends to study of the physical and biological components of place.</p>
            <p class="body">Around three-fourths of all St. Olaf students  participate in off-campus programs, many of them led by St. Olaf faculty  members. In recent years, around 70% of the students in every graduating class have studied internationally, in places as diverse as  Aberdeen, Bangalore, Chiang Mai, Dakar, Irkutsk and Istanbul. Around  15 percent have participated in domestic programs &mdash; ranging from Interim  courses on desert biology or the contemporary art scene in New   York City, to semester programs on urban studies in Chicago or politics in Washington, DC.&nbsp; A number of students find off-campus study so  valuable that they participate in two or three programs during their St. Olaf  careers.</p>
        <p class="body"> Of equal importance is the fact that
                faculty members find these programs extremely rewarding &mdash; both for their students and
              for themselves. That is why, in the more than 40 years that St.
              Olaf has been sponsoring them, the college&rsquo;s field-supervised
              programs (Term in the Middle East, Term in Asia, Global Semester,
              and more recently, Environmental Science in Australia) have been
              led by more than 50 different professors, and 140 faculty members
            have led more than 300 off-campus Interim courses. </p>
        <p class="body"> Each off-campus offering has a program advisor. Program advisors
                are St. Olaf faculty members who are particularly well qualified
            to offer academic advice on specific programs. </p>
            <p class="body"> It is strongly recommended that all first-year students discuss
                off-campus study plans with their academic advisor and with the
                faculty program advisor or the study abroad advisor in the International
              and Off-Campus Studies Office.</p>
            <p class="goldhead">Consortial Activities </p>
            <p class="body"> Exchange agreements and the college&rsquo;s
                membership in consortia make it possible for students to participate
                in a number of exciting off-campus programs in addition to the
            ones sponsored by St. Olaf itself. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is one of 14 liberal arts colleges that make up the
              Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM). Other ACM members are
              Beloit, Carleton, Coe,  Colorado,
              Cornell, Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Luther, Macalester, Monmouth,
              and Ripon. </p>
            <p class="body"> St. Olaf is also a member of the Higher Education Consortium
              for Urban Affairs (HECUA), which offers students specialized programs
                in domestic and international sites focusing on community issues
                and social change.<br />
        </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Policies and Procedures </p>
            <p class="body"> Students are responsible for adhering to the
                regulations and policies contained in the <a href="../academicregs/index.html">Academic Regulations</a>              section of this catalog. In particular, students on St. Olaf
              off-campus programs are directed to refer to the policies on &ldquo;<a href="../academicregs/grades.html#graded">Graded and Ungraded Courses</a>&rdquo; for
                full details on how off-campus programs affect this graduation
                requirement.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Qualifications </p>
            <p class="body"> Nearly all St. Olaf students who study off
                campus do so during their sophomore, junior, or senior years.
                (A few Interims are open to first-year students.) The college&rsquo;s
                4-1-4 calendar (two semesters separated by an Interim in January)
                contributes to the flexibility: it enables students to participate
                in programs that last a month, a summer, a semester, half a
            year, or a full year. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students intending to take part in a recognized program off campus
              must be in good academic standing, be sufficiently mature to benefit
              from such study, and physically able to participate in the core activities of the program. Many programs
              have prerequisites, including introductory or advanced courses
              in a specific discipline or certain levels of language proficiency.
              Some programs are competitive, and applicants are accepted based
              on meeting a standard set of criteria governing the selection process.
              Details about all St. Olaf-approved semester and year-long programs,
              program advisors, prerequisites, and application deadlines and procedures
              are found on the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/international/">International and Off-Campus Studies Web site</a>. Paper pamphlets listing all approved programs are also available.</p>
        <p class="goldhead">Fees </p>
            <p class="body"> Students in all St. Olaf-sponsored programs pay the St. Olaf
              tuition              plus additional travel and on-site costs that vary, depending on the nature of each off-campus program. Apart from these payments, students are expected to cover passport fees, the cost of additional independent travel, and personal expenses on their own.<strong> </strong>St. Olaf financial aid is available for
              St. Olaf off-campus programs. Information about special scholarships
                  for off-campus study is available from the Financial Aid Office
                  or the study abroad advisor in the International and Off-Campus
                  Studies Office. </p>
            <p class="goldhead">Grades, Credits, Registration </p>
            <p class="body"> All off-campus courses are graded and appear
                on the transcript, but only those letter grades given for a course
                taught by a St. Olaf faculty member are calculated into a student&rsquo;s
            grade point average. </p>
            <p class="body"> In order for a student to receive academic credit for off-campus
              study sponsored by an institution with which St. Olaf has a program
              relationship, registration must be completed in advance through St.
              Olaf College. </p>
            <p class="body"> All credits earned on St. Olaf-approved programs are viewed as
                  resident credit. In most cases, students can expect to earn
              the same amount of credit on an off-campus program that they would
                earn on campus during a comparable period of time. </p>
            <p class="body"> Students studying on St. Olaf off-campus programs
                should be aware of the &ldquo;<a href="../academicregs/grades.html">24 graded courses</a>&rdquo; graduation
                requirement. Full details on how this requirement is affected
                by off-campus courses is found in the <a href="../academicregs/index.html">Academic Regulations</a> section
              of this catalog.</p>
        <p class="body"> St. Olaf&rsquo;s <a href="../academicregs/grades.html#su">S/U policy</a> applies to courses
              taken on off-campus programs. </p>
        <p class="goldhead">Credits for Non-St. Olaf Terms Off-Campus </p>
        <p class="body">Students may earn elective credit and credit  toward a major, but they may not fulfill general education requirements through such  programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A maximum of four credits may be earned by transfer from study abroad  during a leave of absence.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>While on  a leave of absence from the college, these students may not register for  subsequent St. Olaf terms through a proxy.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

              will give you an idea of the breadth and depth of St. Olaf&rsquo;s
