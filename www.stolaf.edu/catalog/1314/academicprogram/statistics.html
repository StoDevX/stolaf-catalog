              <p class="programdescription"> With the growing abundance of data gathered in nearly every field, statistical methods have become invaluable for transforming data into useful information. As a subject, statistics is interdisciplinary, spanning the sciences (natural and social), the humanities, and even the arts. Examples of areas of applications include economics, biology, health, education, actuarial sciences, and law. An increasing number of majors and concentrations require or recommend a statistics course.</p>
