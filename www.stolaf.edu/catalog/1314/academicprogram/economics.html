              <p class="programdescription"> The  department encourages students: (1) to learn about the economic,  commercial, and governmental institutions that serve the American and  international communities, (2) to be competent in economic and  statistical analysis, and (3) to be cognizant of historical, global, and moral perspectives on economic and business issues. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMICS major </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Economics  is the study of how people and organizations make decisions, how they  interact with each other, and how institutions and policies can be  designed to improve people&rsquo;s lives. The ambition of those who study  economics is to understand the world around them both as it is and as  it ought to be. The basic principles of economics are applied to a wide  range of social and political challenges that confront us today. These  include international trade, environmental protection, health care,  development, domestic taxes, Federal Reserve policies, labor  outsourcing, and the regulation of private business. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> The economics curriculum at St. Olaf includes theory, applications, institutional studies, and quantitative analysis. Where appropriate, economics courses also pursue historical and ethical concerns. </p>
              <p class="body"> The department offers areas of emphasis for its majors who desire more focused study in finance,  international economics, management, and public policy. The department also supports several programs available  to students regardless of major: an interdisciplinary concentration in  management studies, the programs of the Finstad Office for  Entrepreneurial Studies, study abroad, and internship opportunities. </p>
              <p class="body"> The  economics major serves as excellent preparation for careers in a wide  variety of fields, including economic analysis, banking, accounting,  consulting, health administration, finance, business management,  teaching, and international affairs. The major also provides a solid  foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in  economics, business, public policy, and law. </p>

<p>At one time, roughly one-third of the world's population lived in countries with centrally planned
socialist economies.  The world has witnessed a series of astonishing transitions as these planned
economies moved to introduce market reforms.  This course introduces and applies the basic tools of
economic analysis to understand and explore the transitions taking place in these countries.  The
course focuses principally on China and Russia but will include examples drawn from Eastern Europe
and Cuba.  Offered many Interims.</p>

corporations. Class discussions, small group activities, and guest speakers provide a varied
pedagogical approach. Offered occasionally during Interim.</p>


<p class="coursename"><a name="economics-115"></a>115 Gateways to Economics: Globalization and Poverty</p>
<p>Vigorous debates about globalization and poverty have circulated in the media for the past decade,

              <p class="coursename"><a name="economics-371"></a>371 Economics of Public Policy</p>
<p>Government action affects us all. We pay taxes; we use public roads, schools, and parks. Some
prices we pay are lower due to government subsidies; others are higher due to taxes.  Government
actions influence both the efficiency of our economy and the equity and equality within our
society.  Students learn valuable analytical tools for evaluating public projects, tax policies,
entitlement programs and voting behavior. Prerequisite: Economics 262 and Statistics 263 or
