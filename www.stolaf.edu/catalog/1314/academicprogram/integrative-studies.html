<p class="programdescription"> In the Center for Integrative Studies (CIS), established in 1999, &ldquo;integrative studies&rdquo; refers to learning that intentionally  combines diverse methods, experiences, learning styles, subject  matters, and on- or off-campus resources. The college has a  long-standing commitment to integrative studies, evident in its many successful interdisciplinary majors and concentrations, in the success of the  Paracollege program (1969-2000), and in the faculty&rsquo;s ability to combine  diverse approaches to course subjects. The CIS's principal activity is  to support students who plan and carry out individual, integrative  majors and to help students identify and pursue opportunities for  integrative learning on and off campus. In all these activities, the  goal of the CIS is to enhance the coherence of students&rsquo; academic careers by  encouraging them to make meaningful connections among the many parts of  their educational experience and by helping them build bridges between  the college and other communities. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">THE INDIVIDUAL MAJOR </h5>
              <p class="body"> The  CIS is the academic home for students pursuing self-designed,  integrative majors. Students propose a sequence of courses, seminars,  independent studies, or experiential learning as the means of pursuing  an individual major. Proposals must include (1) a description of the  proposed area of study; (2) a list of 11-12  courses and  other learning experiences, with an explanation of how each contributes  to the major; (3) an initial proposal for a senior  integrative project; and (4) a summary of the student&rsquo;s preparation to carry out the proposed major. Each proposal must have the support of a faculty academic advisor. The coherence, depth, and feasibility of each proposal are evaluated in a faculty  review convened by the CIS, after which the proposal is forwarded to a committee that gives final approval. At the end of the senior year,  the student&rsquo;s work in the major is presented to a CIS faculty certification  committee for review. Proposals for individual majors may be submitted  any time during the sophomore year and the first part of the junior  year. </p>
              <p class="body">Recent individual majors 
                include: Architecture and Scenic Design, Human Resource Psychology;  Intercultural Medical Practice; Social  and Community Development; Religion and the Visual Arts; Growing Up in America: A Systems Thinking Approach; Social Marketing and the Environment; Criminalistics;  Writing for Performance; Philosophy of Religion; Photographic Theory; Organizational Communication; Digital Art and Animation; Neuroscience; Public Health Policy and Management; Health and Wellness in the Third World.</p>
              <div>
                <h6> <span class="body">The Web Portfolio </span></h6>
                <p class="body"> Students  with individual majors create and maintain a public web portfolio. A web  portfolio preserves important learning experiences and academic work.  Its web-based structure allows students to make explicit links within  their own work and to the work of other students or other sites of  public discussion. The web portfolio is presented to the faculty certification committee with the senior project at the end of the major. </p>
                <p class="body"> For  specific requirements for the individual major or for information about  other activities of the Center for Integrative Studies, please contact  the director or program coordinator. </p>

<p class="goldsubhead"> INTEGRATIVE SENIOR PROJECT </p>
                <p class="body"> All senior integrative projects  include work during both semesters of the senior year. For the fall term students choose a level III course or other experience closely related to the topics and activities of the major and senior project, or, in consultation with their faculty advisor, may enroll in IS 391: Senior Project I, an independent course graded on a P/N basis. During the spring term, students must enroll in IS 392: <em>Senior Project II</em>, which involves the completion and public presentation of the senior project. A brief description of the student's major and senior project appears on the official transcript.</p>
                <p class="body">Students may also register independent study (298), independent research (398), or  internships (294/394) through the CIS, if the supervising faculty member advises that as the appropriate course designation.</p>
