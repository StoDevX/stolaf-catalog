              <p> <span class="programdescription">Students  at St. Olaf have the opportunity to study a unique subject &mdash; Norwegian.  St. Olaf is one of a few colleges and universities where students can  use Norwegian to complete their foreign language requirement &mdash; and  beyond the requirement can study the language, literature,  culture, and history of Norway in depth. In addition to graduating with  a major in Norwegian, St. Olaf students have many opportunities to  study and travel in Norway. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> The  study of Norwegian opens the door to another culture and another way of  viewing the world. Students develop skills in communication, research,  analytical thinking, and writing  that are essential to a liberal education and are useful in a wide  range of careers. They learn about Norway&rsquo;s role in  technology,  environmental awareness, social equality, and international  peace initiatives. Some of the world&rsquo;s best literature awaits discovery  by students of Norwegian: works by authors like Ibsen, Hamsun, and  Undset, as well as by writers who have not been translated into  English. Norwegian also enables many students to explore their cultural  heritage and encourages contact with relatives and friends in Norway. </p>

Norwegian majors are  encouraged to use their language skills for learning in other disciplines and to experience the culture firsthand through study in Norway.</span> </p>
