              <p class="programdescription"> Because  language is so fundamental to everything that we do, an understanding  of linguistics is part of a well-rounded liberal arts education. In  addition, the study of linguistics prepares students for careers and  advanced work in fields such as anthropology, business, communications,  computer science, education, English as a second language (ESL),  foreign languages, journalism, neuroscience, speech and hearing  sciences, philosophy, psychology, and other fields requiring  analytical, communication, and research skills. Studying linguistics  enhances your understanding of how language is organized and how it  functions. The linguistic studies program  offers a concentration that encompasses a wide variety of disciplines  and perspectives on language. With a concentration in linguistic  studies, you have the opportunity to explore the interdisciplinary  nature of the study of language and linguistics as well as interact  with and learn from others with similar interests. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> OVERVIEW OF THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p class="body"> Linguistic studies encompasses all areas related to the scientific study of the nature, structure, and function of language. Linguistic studies treats language both as a fundamental human faculty and as a changing  social institution. The field of linguistics includes the relationship  between language and logic, the underlying structures of the brain,  social implications of language, language acquisition (including bilingualism  and second-language acquisition), psychology of language, philosophy of  language, dialects and dialectology, language and literature, the  history and development of specific language families, human-machine  interaction, artificial intelligence, and global communication and  understanding. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/programs/ilos/linguistic.htm">INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE CONCENTRATION</a></h5>
              <p class="body"><a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/learning-outcomes.html"></a></p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS For THE CONCENTRATION </h5>
              <p class="body"> The linguistic studies concentration consists of a minimum of five courses: </p>
              <p class="body">(1) English 250:<em> English Language  and Linguistics</em>; </p>
              <p class="body">                (2) three approved departmental offerings at any level  (with the requirement that students take no more than two of these  three courses within the same department); and</p>
              <p class="body">                (3) one approved level  III seminar or approved advanced study experience. Students wishing to  receive  credit toward the concentration through Independent study, Independent  research, or Internships should consult with the director of linguistic studies. </p>
        </div>
    <div>
              <h5 class="goldhead"> SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">In  addition to taking courses, students can gain experience in the  field and pursue special areas of interest in several ways. Full-time  internships may be arranged during Interim. Internship possibilities  include working in bilingual education, language immersion, or ESL  programs in schools; assisting in language  research laboratories and exploring the world of publishing.  Internships are valuable for confirming one&rsquo;s academic interest in  linguistic studies, learning new skills, and gaining paraprofessional  field experience. </span></p>
          <p class="body"> Independent  study and research projects, usually completed during the junior or  senior year, allow students to explore topics in greater depth than is  possible in a regular course. In recent years, topics have included the  study of American sign language, Spanish language immersion programs at  the elementary school level, and the translation of psychological  tests. </p>
              <p class="body"> Students  may also pursue their study of linguistics through off-campus  coursework in conjunction with St. Olaf&rsquo;s off-campus and international  studies programs in locations as diverse as England, France, Germany,  Norway, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, Russia, Scotland, Spain, and  Tanzania. </p>
