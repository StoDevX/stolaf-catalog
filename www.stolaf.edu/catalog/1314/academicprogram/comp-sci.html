              <p> <span class="faculty"><strong>Faculty, 2013-14:</strong>   Richard J. Allen (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), bioinformatics, programming languages, intelligent tutoring systems; Richard A. Brown (Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science), parallel and distributed computing systems,interdisciplinary applications of computer science;  Charles W. Huff, Jr. (Psychology), social psychology, ethical and social issues in computing; Steven C.

              <p> <span class="programdescription">Computer  science (CS) is the academic discipline that focuses on creative  computing-related problem solving and develops valuable analytical  skills. St. Olaf&rsquo;s CS program  employs &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; personal experience to build up valuable technical skills  while learning powerful computing concepts in a liberal arts  context. Beginning with the introductory  courses, the program&rsquo;s curriculum draws connections with  applications in other disciplines ranging from the natural sciences to the humanities. The program offers an authentic  and satisfying education in the concepts and practices of computer  science; the courses below represent national expectations for an  undergraduate computer science curriculum. Undergraduate research  appears throughout the program, from foundation courses that develop  valuable project skills to advanced courses such as the senior capstone  seminar. St. Olaf is a national leader in incorporating instruction in parallel and distributed computing throughout the curriculum. The program also incorporates a distinct liberal arts  perspective, including emphasis on teamwork and communication skills,  examination of ethical and social issues in computing, and collaboration in upper-level interdisciplinary projects. </span></p>
              <p class="programdescription"> Although CS differs from other computing areas, such as programming, information technology  (IT), and information systems (IS), the study of computer science  serves as excellent preparation for careers in such fields, because the  concepts of computer science provide insights into all forms of  computing. While specific computing systems come and go, the principles  of CS endure for the long term, and persons with awareness of those  principles perceive them in all forms of computing. The program's  emphases on development of creative problem-solving and analytical  thinking abilities, interpersonal skills, and ethical analysis and  awareness enhance any career, whether one becomes a computing  professional or an occasional user. </p>

              <h5 class="goldhead"> overview of the major</h5>
              <p class="body">The CS Program emphasizes the concepts and practices of computer science, as well as applications to other disciplines. The major begins with  foundation courses that present the nature of CS through hands-on experience. The foundation and subsequent core courses together span the national expectations for an undergraduate computer science major curriculum, and advanced courses and electives provide options for depth. Several themes appear throughout the major: breadth-first introductory courses; team collaboration (often interdisciplinary); development of communication skills; thoughtful, structured analysis of ethical and social issues in computing; and undergraduate research, beginning with project skills in early courses and continuing through advanced experiences such as CS 390: <em>Senior Capstone Seminar</em>.</p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">A  student arranges for a computer science major by individual contract  with the computer science faculty. This provides some latitude for  choice according to individual interests and background and allows the  computer science faculty to update the curriculum easily as the field  of computer science evolves. Most contracts adhere to the guidelines  below, which derive from prominent national recommendations for  undergraduate computer science majors. </span></p>
              <p class="body"> Foundation courses: one of Computer Science 121 or 125; Computer Science 241, 251, and 252;  one of Computer Science 231 or Math 232 or Math 252.</p>
              <p class="body"> Core courses: Computer Science 253; Computer Science 263; either Computer Science  276 or 333; and either Computer Science 273, 284, or 300 with parallel and distributed computing.</p>
              <p class="body">Electives and capstone: Computer Science 390 and two approved electives. </p>
              <p class="body">These guidelines represent four levels: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="body">choice of introductory courses (Computer Science  121 or 125) and three &ldquo;second courses&rdquo; (Computer Science 231, 241, 251)  that may be taken in any order (note that the foundation courses offer  non-majors a variety of one- to four-course samples of computer  science);</li>

<div>
              <h5 class="goldhead">SPECIAL PROGRAMS </h5>
          <p class="body">Certain courses in computer science count toward a concentration in linguistics and toward majors in mathematics and biology. Also, certain courses in mathematics and physics can count toward requirements in a computer science major contract. Speak with the computer science program director for details.</p>
              <p class="body">The computer science program offers many opportunities to participate in undergraduate research, often integrated within courses, or through extracurricular activities such as summer research. Ongoing efforts in high-performance cluster and parallel computing,  graphics, 3D computer vision, and declarative approaches to language design provide a foundation for many student projects.</p>
              <p class="body">Collaborative interdisciplinary projects apply computer science to many fields across campus, including environmental studies, linguistics, management studies, physics, and history.</p>
          <p class="goldhead">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE STUDY</p>
              <p class="body">Students considering graduate study in computer science should pursue opportunities that add both breadth and depth in their majors. Standard course offerings provide breadth, in that taking all foundation and core courses plus Computer Science 336 collectively includes material from all 63 required units in the current ACM/IEEE national curricular recommendations, plus over 20 optional units. Graduate-school-bound students are strongly encouraged to pursue undergraduate research involving computer science, and to take courses beyond the minimal major requirements. </p>
              <h5 class="goldhead">COURSES </h5>
              <p class="body">Courses in computer science satisfy the following general education requirements: AQR, WRI, ORC, IST, and EIN.
