Since many disciplines  contribute to the understanding of families, family studies is an  integrative field that synthesizes knowledge from liberal arts  disciplines, particularly psychology, social work, sociology, economics, and political  science. </p>

            <p class="body">This requirement is usually an academic, credit-bearing experience completed during the  senior year (including the previous summer.) It is designed to ensure that concentrators participate in an experience that applies basic knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts about families) to real families in a setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by a faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies <u>prior</u> to enrollment. The  component results in a product or project that reflects experience with families. It could be a panel or talk organized by the student(s), a pamphlet, a web site, a portfolio, an integrative paper, or another approved project. The finished product is presented to senior family studies concentrators. Through the experience, students  demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes for family studies.</p>

            <p class="body">The concentration in family studies is designed to enable students to learn about families in both theory and practice; it is a course of study that can enhance student learning in  any major. This concentration is intended to help to prepare students entering careers with families including marriage and family therapy, education, and ministry, or to family practice in law, medicine, nursing, social work, or public policy. Students who intend to go directly to graduate school should also consider enrollment in a statistics course and a research methods course in social work, psychology, or sociology.</p>
