<p class="programdescription">The Department of Dance is committed to teaching and presenting dance as a vital form of embodied awareness and understanding, communication and expression, all of which are central to education in the liberal and fine arts traditions.</p>

As a result, dance majors come away from St. Olaf College with the ability to manage, direct, and perform with professional companies or as free-lance artists; pursue graduate study in dance therapy, teaching, </span><span class="body">choreography, performance, or the somatic disciplines; enter fields such as the healing professions, arts</span>, <span class="body"> management, psychology, environmental studies, media, and more. In short, a B.A. in dance from St. Olaf College, which engages students in the study of dance as a personal art, a cultural art, and a fine art, prepares dance majors for a wide range of life and career possibilities and options.</span></p>

              <h5 class="goldhead">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR </h5>
              <p> <span class="body">Dance  100, 124, 150, 201, 231,  246, and 399 are the required language-intensive courses (theory courses) in the dance major. In addition, students select the equivalent of two credits in movement-intensive courses (technique courses) in consultation with dance faculty. One of these movement-intensive courses must be Dance 212: <em>Articulate Body</em>. Each student also designs an individualized area of specialty derived from their own interests and investigation. This  area of specialty consists of at least two credits selected from within and or outside the department. The dance major's area of specialty leads to the  creation and implementation of a Senior Dance Capstone Project, which is completed in conjunction with Dance 399: <em>Senior Dance Seminar</em> (must be taken fall of senior year). Sample areas of speciality have resulted in 1) the creation of a children's book teaching dance with a global perspective; 2) a piece of choreography that asks the question, Do numbers possess humanistic qualities?; 3) the performance of a solo dance that explores prejudices against the Latino immigrant community; and 4) a research paper presentation that examines gender in ballet and African American spectacle dance. The dance major curriculum is compatible with other majors.</span></p>
          <p class="body"> Majors  are required to participate in one of the dance companies (Companydance&trade;  or Veselica&trade; International Dance Ensemble) in both performance and production roles. Participation  must be planned in consultation with the dance faculty. </p>
