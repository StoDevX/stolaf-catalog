            <p class="programname"><strong>TRANSFERRING CREDITS TO ST. OLAF </strong></p>
            <p class="goldsubhead"><strong>Policies Governing All Transfer of Credit To St. Olaf College: </strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">Credit for work done at other regionally accredited colleges or universities, if satisfactory in grade and applicable toward a liberal arts degree, is generally allowed to count toward a bachelor&rsquo;s degree at St. Olaf, with some restrictions; see #6 below. A &ldquo;regionally accredited college or university&rdquo; means a liberal arts institution accredited by an approved regional accrediting commission. St. Olaf excludes vocational, technical, business, and on-line/correspondence institutions, even if regionally accredited.</li>
              <li class="body">The following are not transferable as St. Olaf credit: courses that are essentially workshops, camps, summer theater, guides, summer jobs, assistantships, and travel programs; music ensemble participation credits (band, choir, orchestra, etc.); intercollegiate athletic participation;  internships and/or independent study courses taken through another regionally accredited college or university. Courses of fewer than four weeks in length (regardless of the number of class contact hours) are not transferable as St. Olaf credit. Students considering &ldquo;Extension School&rdquo; courses at the University of Minnesota or elsewhere must check with the registrar. </li>
            <li><span class="body">One St. Olaf course credit is equivalent to 4.00 semester or 5.50 quarter credits (hours). A course must meet the normal requirements of a minimum of 36 class contact hours to qualify for St. Olaf credit. If a St. Olaf student has previously taken work on a semester and/or quarter system, semester credits are counted separately from quarter credits and all are converted, using the transfer course scale, to St. Olaf course credits. Once the conversion has been made, the course credits are added together to determine the total number of course credits transferred. <br />
                </span>
                <p class="goldsubhead"><br />
                <span class="coursename style1">Transfer Course Scale: Semester and Quarter Credits Converted to St. Olaf Courses </span></p>
                  <p> <span class="body">0-3 qtr. crs. or 0-2 sem. crs. = 0 St. Olaf course<br />
      4-7 qtr. crs. or 3-5 sem. crs. = 1 St. Olaf course<br />
      8-12 qtr. crs. or 6-8 sem. crs. = 2 St. Olaf courses<br />
      13-18 qtr. crs. or 9-12 sem. crs. = 3 St. Olaf courses<br />
      19-23 qtr. crs. or 13-16 sem. crs. = 4 St. Olaf courses<br />
      24-29 qtr. crs. or 17-19 sem. crs. = 5 St. Olaf courses<br />
      30-34 qtr. crs. or 20-23 sem. crs. = 6 St. Olaf courses<br />
      35-40 qtr. crs. or 24-27 sem. crs. = 7 St. Olaf courses<br />
      41-45 qtr. crs. or 28-30 sem. crs. = 8 St. Olaf courses<br />
      46-50 qtr. crs. or 31-34 sem. crs. = 9 St. Olaf courses</span></p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="body">Only courses graded  C or higher at the original institution are given credit for appropriate courses through transfer. The actual grades earned at other institutions are entered on the student&rsquo;s St. Olaf record but are not considered graded courses that count toward the St. Olaf grade point average. The college does not accept courses awarded pass (P) or satisfactory (S) grades from other institutions.</span></li>
              <li><span class="body">Non-St. Olaf off-campus work during summer school or a term or more of an academic year through another college/university must be evaluated and approved by the registrar in advance. Students must submit a <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/registrar/forms/permissiontotransfercredit.pdf">transfer of credit form</a>  for pre-approval. The student is given a copy of the approved form as a receipt; the registrar retains the original. An official transcript reflecting the completed course work at the host college/university must be sent by that institution directly to the St. Olaf registrar before credit transfer can be considered. The registrar may also request a photocopy or printed copy of the Web pages of the relevant portion of the host college&rsquo;s catalog and the class schedule, course outlines, or syllabi. </span></li>
              <li><span class="body"> Current students should be aware of restrictions on the number of courses that can be transferred from other institutions. After students have matriculated at St. Olaf, unless they are transfer students, they may subsequently transfer a maximum of 4.00 equivalent St. Olaf courses from other colleges or universities to St. Olaf for degree credit; only two (2) general education requirements may be awarded. This applies, as well, to students who take a leave of absence from St. Olaf. <em>A transfer student may be allowed fewer than four equivalent St. Olaf credits after matriculation, depending upon the total credits initially transferred</em>. The specific number allowed is found on the student&rsquo;s degree audit. <br />
                  <br />
                  Course credits earned on St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus programs or through inter-registration with Carleton College or an approved Interim exchange program are excluded from these restrictions. </span></li>
              <li><span class="body">Transfer courses may reduce a student&rsquo;s requirements under the 24-graded-course rule under <a href="../academiclife/ba-gen-grad-requirements.html">GENERAL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</a>. Consult the reduced graded course scale under <a href="counting-courses.html#graded"> GRADED AND UNGRADED COURSES</a> in this catalog.</span></li>
              <li><span class="body">Juniors and seniors planning transfer work from other institutions must be aware of the St. Olaf senior residency requirement. New transfer students must complete a minimum of 17.00 credits at St. Olaf or through St. Olaf programs. Current students must enroll full-time both semesters of their senior year or complete 9 of their last 12 credits at St. Olaf.</span></li>
              <li><span class="body"><strong> General Education (GE) Accreditation: </strong> If transfer work is accepted for St. Olaf credit, the Registrar&rsquo;s Office may authorize GE credit for such work in accordance with the <a href="transferringold.html#geaccred">GENERAL EDUCATION ACCREDITATION OF ST. OLAF-APPROVED TRANSFER COURSES AND OFF-CAMPUS COURSEWORK </a>. New entering transfer students receive a written evaluation of credits accepted by St. Olaf from the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising.<br />
                  <br />
                  At least three (3.00) semester or four (4.00) quarter credits (hours) are required for a transfer course to fulfill a particular general education requirement. A course worth fewer than three semester or four quarter credits cannot by itself satisfy a St. Olaf general education requirement or be applied to a major. <br />
                  <br />
    The following GE requirements are waived for transferred students under certain circumstances:
              </span>
                <p></p>
    <p><span class="body"><strong> The First Year Writing (<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/FYW.pdf">FYW</a>)</strong> requirement is waived for students entering with fifteen (15) or more transfer credits (junior standing). <br />
        <strong> Writing in Context:</strong> One Writing in Context requirement (<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/WRI.pdf">WRI</a>) is waived for students entering with six to fourteen (6-14) transfer credits (sophomore standing); two Writing in Context requirements (<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/WRI.pdf">WRI</a>) are waived for students entering with fifteen to eighteen (15-18) transfer credits (junior standing). <br />
        <strong> The Biblical Studies requirement (<a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/BTS-B.pdf">BTS-B</a>)</strong> is waived for students entering with fifteen (15) or more transfer credits (junior standing).</span></p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="body">Students wishing to apply a transfer course toward a major or a concentration should consult with the department chair or program director. Courses not granted preliminary approval for transfer by the registrar are not allowed for transfer credit, regardless of the judgment of a department or program about their suitability for a major. </span></li>

            <ol>
              <li><span class="body">Transfer students should seek admission to St. Olaf by contacting the director of admissions. During the admissions process, the registrar is asked by the Office of Admissions to provide the applicant with an evaluation of transfer credit, based on official transcripts. For additional information, see <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/applying/transfer.html"> http://www.stolaf.edu/admissions/applying/transfer.html</a> .</span></li>
              <li><span class="body"> All students transferring to St. Olaf from other colleges or universities must be aware of restrictions on the number of transfer credits allowed after matriculation to St. Olaf. The number of additional transfer credits allowed is printed on the degree audit. </span></li>
              <li><span class="body">Transfer students should become familiar with the college&rsquo;s <a href="course-reg.html#su">S/U policy</a>. Students who are transferring more than six courses to St. Olaf from another institution may have the allowable number of permitted S/U courses reduced by scale. This scale is recorded by the registrar on the evaluation of transfer credit form returned to the transfer applicant during the admission process and is posted on the student&rsquo;s degree audit.</span></li>
              <li><span class="body">Transfer students who have previously received college credit for courses taken in high school or college courses taken while in high school should be aware of the college&rsquo;s policies. See <a href="entering-stolaf.html"> PRE-COLLEGE CREDITS APPLIED TO ST. OLAF COLLEGE</a>. College Board Advanced Placement credit is considered if the transfer student provides St. Olaf with the original scores. </span></li>

The amount of GE credit a student may earn will depend on the source of the work being accredited, that is, whether it was earned through work completed prior to enrollment at St. Olaf, work completed on a faculty-led international program, work completed at another university, etc. <strong><em>Non-St. Olaf abroad program courses do not fulfill any General Education requirements. </em></strong></li>
