<p>Third-semester music majors continue formal musicianship studies. Students perform advanced
rhythms and increasingly chromatic melodies at sight. Students analyze and compose Western
tonal music that employs modal mixture, Neapolitan chords, augmented-sixth chords, and remote
modulations, all of which are closely integrated into melodic and harmonic dictations. Students
analyze the principle movement-length forms. Prerequisite: Music 114. Offered annually in the
fall semester.</p>
