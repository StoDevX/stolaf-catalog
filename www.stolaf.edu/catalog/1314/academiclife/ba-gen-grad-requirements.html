Sophomore transfer students need a minimum of 18 graded credits and junior transfer students a minimum of 13 graded credits. Details are available from the registrar. </p>

        <p class="subhead"><b>7. Major &mdash; 8 or More  Credits</b></p>
        <p class="body">One completed major is required for graduation. Depending on the department or interdisciplinary program, the number of courses required for a major ranges from eight to twelve courses, with some departments requiring course work in other departments. Departments and interdisciplinary programs may require comprehensive examinations or special research projects. (See <a href="majors-and-more.html">Majors, Concentrations, and Areas of Emphasis.</a>) Consult the <a href="../academicprogram/index.html">department or interdisciplinary program listing</a> in this catalog for specific major requirements. Students must declare one major no later than the time of registration for Interim and spring semester  of their junior year by filling out a <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/registrar/files/2012/11/majordeclare.pdf">form</a> available at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising. Students are allowed to change this declaration or add a second major at a later date. Only this catalog defines the specific requirements for each departmental or interdisciplinary major. </p>
        <p class="body">Other regulations are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="body">Of the  credits counting toward the minimum requirements for a major, a total of six (6.00) must be completed with a grade of C or higher. </li>
          <li class="body">Only one full-course equivalent (1.00-credit course) taken S/U may count toward the minimum requirements for a major. Some departments have more stringent regulations. </li>
          <li class="body">At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St. Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the appropriate department chair or program director about counting toward a major courses taken at other colleges. In addition to the registrar, the chair must sign the student&rsquo;s transfer of credit form (available from the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other institutions is accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-campus programs must be approved by the chair or director and the off-campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major is sought. (See <a href="../academicregs/transferringold.html#transfercourses">TRANSFER OF CREDIT TO ST. OLAF </a>) </li>
          <li class="body">Certification of a completed major is the responsibility and prerogative of the department chair or program director, not the registrar.</li>
          <li class="body">See below, <a href="ba-gen-grad-requirements.html#outside">Credits Outside the Major.</a></li>
        </ul>
<p class="subhead">Multiple Majors: </b></p>
            <p class="body">Attaining two or three majors within the confines of 35 St. Olaf credits is often difficult. Students should consult frequently with their advisor and the chair or director of the major departments and programs.  A graduate may add an additional major to the St. Olaf record if no more than two courses from another institution are subsequently applied to the additional major.
              </p>
<p class="subhead"><b><a name="outside" id="outside"></a>8. Credits Outside the Major </b></p>
            <p class="body">While the maximum course credits counting toward a major in any one department  may vary, 21 total full-course credits must be completed outside of the SIS &quot;department&quot; code of the major. The 21 total credits include Education Department courses attending the major. In order for a student to be certified in a second or third major, 21 credits also must be taken outside of the SIS &quot;department&quot; code of each of those majors as well.  If a student has a double major, courses taken in one major count toward the 21 credits outside of the other major. Credits outside the major department or program include full- (1.00) credit courses plus partial - (.25,  .50, .75) credit courses. </p>
        <p class="subhead"><b>9. Completion of Incomplete Grades</b></p>
            <p class="body">A student with an <a href="http://stolaf.edu/catalog/1314/academicregs/grades.html#incompletes">incomplete</a> on his/her academic record may participate in Commencement if all other requirements for graduation have been met (see<a href="../academicregs/graduating.html#participate"> PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT</a>). Only after a final grade has been recorded for the course, however, will a degree be conferred and a diploma issued. </p>
