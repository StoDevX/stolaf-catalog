          <p class="programname">Requirements for B.A. Degree
            Candidates</p>
            <p class="goldhead"> General Education Requirements </p>
            <p class="body">General education requirements constitute the core degree requirements of the curriculum.  Courses are described in this catalog;  general education attributes for all courses are indicated in the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/sis/public-aclasslab.cfm">class and lab schedule</a>. </p>
        <p class="body">St. Olaf&rsquo;s general education curriculum does not work by a distribution system (so many courses in certain disciplines); rather, it identifies an area of learning for general education and sets out a series of guidelines and intended learning outcomes that inform the construction of courses. Departments and programs submit their course proposals to the Curriculum Committee, which judges whether a course fulfills a specific general education requirement. Because the college&rsquo;s expectations for general education are distinctive and characteristic of St. Olaf College alone, students must be particularly careful as they plan off-campus and transfer work. The Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising determines how transfer work  applies to St. Olaf&rsquo;s general education requirements; advisors of approved St. Olaf programs determine whether a course taken through one of these programs/approved by St. Olaf applies to the general education requirements. See <a href="../academicregs/transferringold.html">TRANSFER OF CREDIT TO ST. OLAF</a>. </p>
        <p class="body">Some courses in the St. Olaf curriculum count for more than one graduation requirement at the same time. For example, a course taken for general education may also be the first course in a major. A course may simultaneously satisfy two different general education requirements. In addition, students may complete some requirements with approved courses taken on St. Olaf-approved international and off-campus programs. </p>
            <p class="body">A typical course of study may have proportions as follows: </p>
            <p class="body">              <b>General Education:</b> 14-16  credits<br />
              <b>Major:</b> 8-10  credits <br />
              <b>Electives:</b> 10-12  credits<br />
        <b>Total for graduation:</b> 35  credits</p>
            <p class="body">Depending upon Advanced Placement examination results, choice of world language, prior preparation in languages and mathematics, choice of a major, and addition of a second major, a concentration, or a teaching certification, the proportions will vary. </p>
            <p class="body">The codes for the general education requirements are listed under each requirement. The code for each requirement fulfilled by a course is listed in the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/classlab/">class and lab schedule</a>, not in the course listings in this catalog. </p>
        <p class="body">Of courses taken to meet general education requirements, only .25 credit courses may be taken on a <a href="http://stolaf.edu/catalog/1314/academicregs/grades.html#su">satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U)</a> basis. Full or .50 credit courses taken S/U do not fulfill general education requirements. </p>
        <p class="body">An <a href="http://stolaf.edu/catalog/1314/academicregs/course-reg.html#ISIR">independent study or an independent research</a> credit does not fulfill a general education requirement for the degree. Exception: In consultation with the faculty supervisor and with the approval of the registrar, independent study or independent research may count as a course in writing <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/committees/curriculum/ge/WRI.pdf">[WRI</a>].</p>
        <p class="goldhead">FOUNDATION STUDIES </p>
        <p class="subhead"><strong>First-Year Writing [<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/files/2013/12/FYW.pdf">FYW</a>] -- 1 course </strong></p>
        <p class="body">First-year students are required  to complete First-Year Writing (FYW), with two exceptions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="body">FYW is awarded to first-year  students who receive a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) English  Literature or English Language Exam or a score of 5 or higher on the  International Baccalaureate (IB) exam. </li>
          <li class="body">Students who initially  transfer 15 or more courses to St. Olaf are exempt from the FYW requirement.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body"><strong>Placement:</strong>&nbsp;The director of  writing administers a writing placement exam for first-year students whose SAT  verbal and writing scores, ACT English and reading scores, or additional  admissions materials indicate that they may benefit from taking Writing 107 or  Writing 110 before enrolling in a First-Year Writing course. New incoming students required  to take the writing placement exam receive written notification, during the  summer and upon arrival to campus, from the director of writing. The writing  placement exam is offered only during Week One. International students take a  writing placement exam as part of international student orientation.</p>
        <p class="body">          Students who may benefit from a two-semester  sequence of writing instruction complete Writing 107:&nbsp;<em>Introduction to  Academic Writing</em>, or Writing 110:&nbsp;<em>Critical Skills in Composition</em>,  in the first semester of the first year, then complete a Writing 111 in the  second semester of the first year. All other students may enroll directly in a  Writing 111 section.</p>
<p class="subhead"><strong>Writing in Context Courses [<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/files/2013/12/WRI.pdf">WRI</a>] -- 4 courses in any departments/programs</strong></p>
        <p class="subhead"><strong>Foreign Language [<a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/files/2013/12/FOL.pdf">FOL</a>] -- 0-4 courses</strong></p>
        <p class="body"><strong class="goldsubhead"><a name="FOL" id="FOL"></a>B.A. FOL</strong></p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Foreign Language [</strong><a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/curriculum-committee/files/2013/12/FOL.pdf"><strong>FOL</strong></a><strong>] -- 0-4 courses</strong> </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Requirement</strong>: All St.  Olaf students must satisfy the foreign language requirement. Bachelor of Arts  students must satisfactorily complete the fourth college semester course  (numbered 232 or higher) taught in the French [FOL-F], German [FOL-G], or  Spanish [FOL-S] languages; or the third college semester course (numbered 231  or higher) taught in the Chinese [FOL-C], Greek [FOL-K], Latin [FOL-L],  Japanese [FOL-J], Norwegian [FOL-N], or Russian [FOL-R] languages, or  demonstrate equivalent proficiency.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Requirement  to be completed at St. Olaf</strong>: New  matriculating students are expected to complete their foreign language (FOL)  requirement with a course or courses taken at St. Olaf. In  general, students are advised to begin foreign language study in the first  semester of the first year and to continue their language study in each  subsequent semester until the requirement is completed. In cases where a  student&rsquo;s schedule of courses makes that impossible, the student should consult  with his or her advisor. After a student  matriculates, under special circumstances, the registrar, in consultation with  the appropriate foreign language department, may grant permission to a student  to complete the final course for the FOL requirement through summer intensive  or semester courses (through a leave of absence) taken at another institution.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Placement:</strong> Foreign language departments place first-year  students and other new students in appropriate language courses on the basis of  placement tests or high school preparation. Students entering with previous training in a foreign  language&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;take the relevant placement test if one is  offered. The foreign language placement tests are relatively short diagnostic  tests; they should not be considered exhaustive and do not provide a  satisfactory basis for the certification of proficiency or for receiving course  credit. Rather, they function entirely for placement in St. Olaf language  courses.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Proficiency</strong>: New matriculating or new transfer students who  have taken college-level foreign language courses at another institution may  receive elective credit for those courses, within the maximum number of  pre-college credits allowed by St. Olaf, if the courses are deemed appropriate  by the registrar. If new matriculating students decide to complete the FOL requirement  in the language in which they have prior training, they must take and pass the  necessary course(s) according to the placement test results and the FOL policy  for the specific language. Students who place higher than the last course  normally required to complete the FOL requirement may be eligible to take a  proficiency exam. The foreign language proficiency tests are administered by  the various foreign language departments. The foreign language proficiency  tests measure proficiency at a level equivalent to the end of the corresponding  number 231 or 232 language course. A student who passes the appropriate  proficiency test satisfies the St. Olaf foreign language requirement (FOL) but  does not receive course credit. Please consult individual departments for  information about their FOL policies. <br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Languages  not taught at St. Olaf</strong>: If new matriculating students or new transfer students wish to  complete their FOL requirement with courses in a language not taught at St.  Olaf, including American Sign Language (ASL), the course(s) must comply with  college policy for completion of the FOL requirement, as determined by the  registrar. Students planning to fulfill the foreign language requirement with  transfer courses from other institutions should be aware of St. Olaf&rsquo;s  requirement of intermediate proficiency in one foreign language (including  American Sign Language [ASL]). Questions regarding the transfer of foreign language  courses to St. Olaf should be directed in advance to the registrar. <br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Native  language other than English</strong>: Students  who enter St. Olaf College with a native language other than English should  consult the registrar. Such students may have their foreign language  requirement fulfilled by showing evidence of proficiency in their native  language. These students must prove completion through eighth grade in their  native language; or they must provide a high school transcript that shows they  completed their high school requirements in their native language; or they must  pass a proficiency test through St. Olaf (see above) or administered by an  outside evaluator.&nbsp; <br />
        </p>
        <p class="body">Proficiency reports from persons not known to  St. Olaf must be based on documented exposure or training by the student in a  foreign language equivalent in length to three or four college semesters or  demonstration of a sufficient length of time in a non-English speaking culture  to give credence to a proficiency report. As a rule, proficiency reports from  persons outside of St. Olaf are not acted upon until the student arranges for a  final proficiency exam by persons and methods agreed to by members of the foreign  language faculty, the registrar, and, if deemed necessary, the dean of the  college. Such exams may involve an expense charged to the student.</p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Documented  language learning disability</strong>: Students with a documented language  learning disability should confer with the Student Accessibility Services in  the Academic Support Center.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Difficulty progressing</strong>: Students who  have difficulty making progress in foreign language courses at the college  should first consult the instructors of their foreign language courses and  their academic advisors; these faculty may also refer students to the Academic  Support Center. Students are strongly urged to seek the support of a tutor and  meet with that tutor on a regular schedule.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="body"><strong>Alternative  route</strong>: In very rare cases, the foreign language requirement may be  fulfilled by another method: students who have not fulfilled the foreign  language requirement may petition the Foreign Language Subcommittee of the  Curriculum Committee to satisfy the remainder of the requirement by completing  one or more substitute courses in foreign culture and civilization or in  literature in English translation. In compliance with state and federal  disability discrimination laws, this alternative route to fulfillment of the  foreign language requirement is intended for students with disabilities  specific to the learning of foreign languages. Any petition should be drawn up  with the guidance of the Academic Support Center.

        <p class="body"><strong>Placement:</strong> The Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department recommends courses for students to take based on their responses to the Mathematics/Statistics and Computer Science placement surveys. Students who do not need to take calculus for their major may&nbsp;want to wait until at least their sophomore year before deciding which mathematics, statistics, or computer science course is the best option for them to take to satisfy the AQR requirement.</p>

        <p> <span class="body">Two different courses, of any credit value,  that expand students' experiences in and understanding of movement and promote lifelong health and wellness of the whole person. Students are encouraged to expland their horizons and focus on different activities or modes of movement in order to fulfill the requirements. </span></p>
        <p class="body"> It is strongly recommended that both SPM requirements be completed before the senior year. The following regulations are often misunderstood: </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="body"> If students do not appear on the first class day of an SPM course, the instructor normally assumes that the student will drop the course. In this event, the student must still officially drop the course at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising by the posted drop deadline. The instructor does not assume this responsibility. </li>
          <li class="body"> Only one SPM course credit may be earned by students as a result of participation in an approved intercollegiate sport. This credit must be entered as Exercise Science 171-194 at the registration preceding the sport/participation term. Credit cannot be claimed after the term in which participation took place unless the student completes a petition form; a late fee is assessed. An intercollegiate SPM (.25) credit can only be used within the two-course SPM graduation requirement. An intercollegiate SPM (.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose of earning a credit toward the 35 full-credit course requirement for graduation. It can only be used once as one half of the two-course SPM requirement. </li>
          <li class="body"> At registration, students may register initially for only one SPM course. On a space-available basis a second SPM course may be added during the same term with a signed drop/add slip within the drop/add dates published on the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising Web site. </li>
          <li class="body"> After the two-course SPM requirement has been completed, students may repeat  a specific exercise science activity (ESAC) course under the following conditions: </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li class="body"> The SPM requirement is completed with two different courses. </li>
            <li class="body"> Students repeating an ESAC course must wait until the first day of classes to register the repeated activity course, to allow all current students to register for SPM courses. </li>
            <li class="body"> Students may only register on a &ldquo;space available&rdquo; (open courses) basis. </li>
            <li class="body"> Each specific exercise science activity course may only be taken a maximum of four times (the first time plus three repeats). </li>
