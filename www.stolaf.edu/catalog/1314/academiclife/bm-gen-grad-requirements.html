                either (a) during the last two semesters and Interim preceding the
                conferring of the degree or (b) for at least nine of the last 12 full
                course credits. For instance, seniors may spend one of their last terms at
                another institution only if a maximum of three credits are applied to the
                St. Olaf degree. A senior may spend the final semester on a St.

            exchange with another 4-1-4 college. Transfer students admitted with at least
            sophomore standing must complete two Interims. After having successfully
            completed two Interims, senior participators may satisfy the third Interim

            chair must sign the student&rsquo;s transfer of credit form (available from the
            Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other institutions is accepted in
            advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-campus programs must
            be approved by the chair or director and the off-campus program advisor in
